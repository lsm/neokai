# E2E Quick - Fast E2E tests with coverage collection
#
# Runs representative E2E tests (~11 tests) with BOTH server and browser coverage.
# For full E2E test suite (70+ tests), use e2e-matrix.yml (manual trigger).
#
# Server coverage: Bun test --coverage instruments daemon/shared code running in-process
# Browser coverage: Playwright CDP collects V8 coverage from browser
