# Contributing to NeoKai

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeoKai! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `bun install`
4. Create a new branch from `dev` for your changes

## Branching Strategy

This project uses `dev` as the sole integration and release branch:

### Branches

- **`dev`** (default branch) - Active development and release branch
  - All feature branches should target `dev`
  - PRs to `dev` run lint, type check, unit tests, and integration tests
  - Push to `dev` triggers the full CI gate (including web tests, CLI tests, build)
  - Releases go directly from `dev` via version tags
  - E2E tests run on-demand via `workflow_dispatch`

### Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   # make changes
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   # create PR targeting dev
   ```

2. **After PR is merged to `dev`**
   - Monitor CI to ensure all checks pass
   - Dev branch is the source of truth

3. **Releasing**
   - Bump version and create a PR to `dev` (see [`docs/release-process.md`](docs/release-process.md))
   - Tag the merge commit: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
   - The release pipeline builds, publishes to npm, and creates a GitHub Release

### CI/CD Pipeline

| Event | Target Branch | Tests Run |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| PR → `dev` | `dev` | Lint, type check, unit tests, integration tests |
| Push to `dev` | `dev` | Lint, type check, unit tests, integration tests, web tests, CLI tests, build |
| `workflow_dispatch` | any | **All** tests including E2E |
## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the codebase
- Run `bun run lint` to check for linting errors
- Run `bun run format` to format code automatically

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR: `bun test`
- For E2E tests: `cd packages/e2e && bun test`

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test-related changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `ci:` for CI/CD changes

Example:
```
feat: add model switching support in coordinator mode

- Add model parameter to coordinator options
- Update UI to show current model
- Add tests for model switching
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with `dev`
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase dev
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** targeting the `dev` branch

3. **Provide a clear description** of your changes
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How does it work?
   - Are there any breaking changes?

4. **Wait for CI checks to pass**
   - PRs to dev run lint, type check, unit tests, and integration tests
   - All other checks must pass

5. **Request review** from maintainers

6. **Address feedback** from reviewers
   - Make requested changes
   - Push updates to your branch

7. **Merge** will happen after approval and passing checks
