/**
 * Workflow autonomy helpers.
 *
 * Determines whether a `SpaceWorkflow` will auto-close at a given Space
 * autonomy level. The UI uses this to tell users — at a glance — how many
 * of a Space's workflows skip human review at the currently-selected level.
 *
 * Rules (as of PR 4/5 — post completion-action deletion):
 *   - A workflow auto-closes at level N iff `level >= (wf.completionAutonomyLevel ?? 5)`.
 *   - `completionAutonomyLevel` is a first-class field on `SpaceWorkflow`; it
 *     defaults to `5` (effectively always paused) when omitted so legacy
 *     workflows remain conservatively gated until an author opts in.
 *
 * This is a pure function with no DB or runtime dependencies — safe to use
 * from both the daemon and the web bundle.
