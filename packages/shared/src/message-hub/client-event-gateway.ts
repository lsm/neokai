/**
 * ClientEventGateway — typed boundary around client-facing event delivery.
 *
 * Today, daemon code reaches into `MessageHub.event(method, data, { channel })`
 * directly whenever it needs to push state to WebSocket clients. That works,
 * but it means every domain service is coupled to the transport API and
 * must remember to construct the channel string by hand.
 *
 * `ClientEventGateway` is the seam introduced in the architecture plan
 * (`docs/plans/internal-event-command-query-architecture.md`):
 *
 *   • daemon services emit a typed `EventChannel`,
 *   • the gateway serializes the channel via {@link channelRegistry} and
 *     delegates to `MessageHub.event(...)`.
 *
 * Scope (foundation milestone)
 * ----------------------------
 * This is a thin adapter, intentionally. It does **not** yet:
 *   • own state projection (still in `StateManager`),
 *   • implement the declarative `ClientEventBridge` mapping internal events
 *     to client events (a later milestone),
 *   • track per-channel cycle versions (still in `StateManager`).
 *
 * Keeping the gateway minimal lets us migrate one or two `messageHub.event(...)`
 * call sites at a time without rewriting `StateManager` wholesale, while still
 * giving every new client-facing publisher a single place to land.
 *
 * Migration strategy
 * ------------------
 * 1. Add the gateway and start using it for low-conflict broadcasts (e.g.
 *    `session.created`, `session.deleted`, `context.updated`). These have
 *    simple payloads and clear channels.
 * 2. As `StateManager` is split into projection + bridge in follow-up PRs,
 *    each new bridge handler emits via `ClientEventGateway` from day one.
 * 3. Eventually the direct `messageHub.event(...)` import disappears from
 *    daemon application code; only the gateway and transport-internal code
 *    talk to `MessageHub`.
