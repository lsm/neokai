 * Gate Open State Repository
 *
 * Persistence layer for the gate-open cache, keyed by `(run_id, gate_id)`.

 * `updatedAt` timestamp so subsequent calls skip re-evaluation. On daemon
 * restart, the persisted state survives and avoids redundant re-evaluations.
 *
 * If the workflow definition changes (different `updatedAt`), the cached
 * entry is considered stale and the gate is re-evaluated.
