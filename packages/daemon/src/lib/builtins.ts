/**
 * Built-in MCP servers and skills registry.
 *
 * This file is the **single source of truth** for everything that ships
 * pre-configured with the daemon:
 *
 *   • `BUILTIN_MCP_SERVERS` — rows inserted into `app_mcp_servers` on first
 *     boot by `seedDefaultMcpEntries()`.
 *   • `BUILTIN_SKILLS`      — rows inserted into `skills` on first boot by
 *     `SkillsManager.initializeBuiltins()`.
 *
 * Adding a new built-in is a one-file data change: append to the relevant
 * array below. The seeders iterate these tables — no ad-hoc `initFoo()`
 * methods to keep in sync across files.
 *
 * # Wiring
 *
 * Under M1 MCP unification the SDK runs with `strictMcpConfig: true`, which
 * means it no longer auto-discovers `.mcp.json` / settings-file servers.
 * Sessions only see MCP servers that are referenced by an enabled skill. So
 * for an MCP server to reach a session, there must be:
 *
 *   1. an `app_mcp_servers` row (defined here in `BUILTIN_MCP_SERVERS`), AND
 *   2. a `skills` row with `sourceType: 'mcp_server'` pointing at it
 *      (defined here in `BUILTIN_SKILLS`).
 *
 * `QueryOptionsBuilder.getMcpServersFromSkills()` walks the skills table and
 * resolves each `mcp_server` skill back to its app_mcp_servers row, which is
 * how the server config finds its way into the SDK query options.
