/**
 * CompletionDetector
 *
 * Determines whether a workflow run is complete by inspecting the canonical
 * `SpaceTask` — never `NodeExecution`. Per the workflow completion contract:
 *
 *   - Node-execution statuses (`idle`, `cancelled`, etc.) are about per-execution
 *     lifecycle, NOT workflow completion. An idle end-node may still re-activate
 *     via cyclic re-entry; a cancelled execution may be a transient error.
 *   - The single source of truth for "this workflow is finished" is the canonical
 *     `SpaceTask` linked to the workflow run.
 *
 * Two completion signals — both inspected here:
 *
 *  1. `task.status` is terminal (`done` | `cancelled`) — the canonical task
 *     has reached its end state, either via runtime resolution or human override.
 *     Note: `archived` is also a terminal status but we treat it as "out of scope"
 *     here — completion handling is for active workflow lifecycle, not soft-delete.
 *
 *  2. `task.reportedStatus` is non-null — the end-node agent reported its result
 *     via `report_result`. The runtime's tick will resolve the final task status
 *     on the next pass through `resolveCompletionWithActions` (which honors the
 *     supervised-mode review gate). Returning true here causes that resolution
 *     to fire.
 *
 * TODO: stall detection (gap #13) — once nothing is `pending`/`in_progress` and
 * the task is still `in_progress` with no `reportedStatus`, the workflow is
 * stalled (e.g. dead-loop, all agents idle waiting for input). That detection
 * is out of scope for this change; see `docs/space-autonomy-hitl-gaps-claude-opus-4-6.md`.
