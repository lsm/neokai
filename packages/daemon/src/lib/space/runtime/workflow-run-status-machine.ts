/**
 * WorkflowRunStatusMachine
 *
 * Defines the valid status transitions for the agent-centric workflow run lifecycle.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   pending        → in_progress   (startWorkflowRun promotes immediately after creation)
 *   pending        → cancelled     (error during run initialization before tasks created)
 *   in_progress    → done          (all agents reached terminal status)
 *   in_progress    → blocked       (agent failed or gate blocked requiring human action)
 *   in_progress    → cancelled     (explicit cancellation via API)
 *   blocked        → in_progress   (human resolved the blocking issue)
 *   blocked        → cancelled     (explicit cancellation while blocked)
 *   done           → in_progress   (reopen: follow-up message to a "finished" run)
 *   cancelled      → in_progress   (reopen: resume a previously cancelled run)
 *
 * The only true tombstone for the unit of work is `SpaceTask.archivedAt`;
 * workflow-run status is a *lifecycle* state that can re-enter `in_progress`
 * as long as the parent task has not been archived. See ChannelRouter for the
 * archive check that guards reopen.

 * the parent task is still live (not archived). The archive check lives in
 * ChannelRouter; this table just permits the transition.
