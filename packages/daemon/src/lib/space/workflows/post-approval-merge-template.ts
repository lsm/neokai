/**
 * Shared "merge the PR" post-approval instructions template.
 *
 * Referenced verbatim from
 * `docs/plans/remove-completion-actions-task-agent-as-post-approval-executor.md`
 * §5 — "Merge-template `instructions` string (shared across Coding, Research,
 * QA)."
 *
 * Delivered to the reviewer post-approval session by `PostApprovalRouter` when
 * a workflow declares `postApproval.targetAgent = 'reviewer'`. Template tokens
 * follow the §1.6 grammar evaluated by
 * `post-approval-template.ts:interpolatePostApprovalTemplate`. Recognised
 * tokens used below:
 *
 *   - `{{pr_url}}`          — signalled by the end node via
 *                             `send_message(task-agent, …, data:{ pr_url })`.
 *   - `{{approval_source}}` — `'human' | 'agent'` (from
 *                             `SpaceApprovalSource`; `auto_policy` is
 *                             theoretically possible but no caller produces
 *                             it for post-approval).
 * NOTE: The `{{reviewer_name}}` token was intentionally replaced with the
 * static string `[end-node reviewer]` in PR 3/5 because nothing in
 * `dispatchPostApproval` currently resolves the approving agent's slot name
 * into `routeContext.reviewer_name`. Threading the name through from
 * `onApproveTask` is tracked as a follow-up (PR 4/5 / PR 5/5). Leaving the
 * token as a literal `{{reviewer_name}}` would degrade the reviewer
 * sub-session's kickoff, so it is rendered as a stable human-readable label
 * for now.
 *
 * Workflow authors referencing this template MUST ensure their end node signals
 * `{ pr_url }` (inside the `data` payload of `send_message(target:
 * 'task-agent', …)` and/or `save_artifact({ type: 'result', data: { pr_url } })`)
 * before `approve_task()` / `submit_for_approval()`. The earlier §2.1
 * `post_approval_action` discriminator was removed — post-approval routing is
 * declarative on the workflow's `postApproval` field, not signalled at runtime.
 *
 * The runtime appends the universal `mark_complete` instruction in
 * `PostApprovalRouter`; keep this workflow data focused on PR-specific work.
