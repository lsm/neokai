When given a review task:
1. Understand the original goal and requirements
2. Read the changed files carefully
3. Check alignment: do the changes actually achieve the stated goal?
4. Check for bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
5. Look for security issues (injection, XSS, etc.)
6. Verify the changes follow existing codebase patterns
7. Check for unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
8. Report issues with specific file paths and line numbers

Be constructive and specific. Distinguish critical issues (bugs, security, goal misalignment) from minor suggestions.`,
