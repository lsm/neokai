/**
 * Loop Detector Hook
 *
 * Detects and recovers from "dead loops" where the agent calls the same
 * tool repeatedly with identical arguments without making forward progress.
 *
 * Real-world trigger (task #324, see task #328): the coder agent called
 * `Read` on `client-event-bridge.ts` ~60 times in a single turn before the
 * user intervened. The file content was unchanged across every read; the
 * agent had entered a degenerate planning state. A separate report (task
 * #333) flagged the same failure mode for Bash — e.g. the agent runs
 * `ls -la .git/hooks 2>&1` 60 times, each time getting the same error, never
 * adjusting its approach.
 *
 * ─── Strategy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `PreToolUse` hook keeps a per-(session, agent) ledger of the *current
 * consecutive streak* — i.e. successive invocations of the same
 * `(tool_name, args)` key with no intervening different tool call. Read /
 * Grep / Glob are pure functions of the filesystem, so identical repeats
 * almost never produce different output: we deny purely on repetition at a
 * low threshold (3–5).
 *
 * Bash needs a different policy because legitimate retries DO produce
 * different output (polling `git status`, re-running `bun test` after a
 * fix). We therefore use a **hybrid**: a companion `PostToolUse` hook
 * records the outcome of each Bash call into a per-key failure ring buffer.
 * The `PreToolUse` hook denies only when ALL of:
 *   1. Bash was called with the same fingerprint N times in a row (N=5).
 *   2. The last N outcomes were all failures.
 *   3. The streak fits inside the sliding window.
 *
 * A successful Bash call clears that key's failure ring, so a flaky command
 * that eventually succeeds does not get blocked on the next attempt. A
 * `PostToolUseFailure` (true SDK error, e.g. hook crash, sandbox kill) is
 * recorded as a failure too.
 *
 * ─── Streak reset ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The hook is registered for ALL tools (not just tracked ones) so any
 * different action — running a different Bash command, editing a file,
 * even calling a non-tracked inspection tool — counts as a "different
 * action" and resets the streak for the *other* tracked tools. This means
 * a denied Read can be unstuck by an Edit; a denied Bash can be unstuck by
 * a Read, a different Bash, or any other tool call. The streak only
 * persists across truly identical consecutive calls.
 *
 * ─── Scoping ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Streaks are tracked per `(session_id, agent_id)` pair, so parallel
 * subagents under the same parent session cannot contribute to each
 * other's counters and a subagent's reads do not pollute the main thread's
 * streak.
 *
 * ─── Repeat denies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When a stuck agent keeps hammering the same call after a deny, the streak
 * does NOT reset on a deny — every retry without an intervening different
 * action continues to deny. This is intentional: the goal is to break the
 * loop, not just throttle it. The streak resets when the agent performs a
 * *different* tool call (tracked OR untracked) or the sliding window
 * elapses over the streak's lifetime. For Bash, the deny additionally
 * requires the persistent-failure condition, so a stuck loop of failing
 * commands keeps being denied until the agent does something different OR
 * the next invocation of that same command happens to succeed (which would
 * have to come from outside the deny path, i.e. after a streak reset).
