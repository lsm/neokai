/**
 * Post-Approval: Human-rejected merge at low autonomy (Level 1) E2E Tests
 *
 * PR 4/5 of
 * `docs/plans/remove-completion-actions-task-agent-as-post-approval-executor.md`
 * §4.6 requires this test: a Level-1 space where the human REJECTS the
 * merge via `request_human_input`. The reviewer session must NOT call
 * `gh pr merge`; the task must still end at `done` (or `approved` with
 * a `postApprovalBlockedReason`) and an audit artifact must record the
 * rejection.
 *
 * This is the counterpart to `post-approval-merge-autonomy-low.e2e.ts`
 * and asserts the "human says no" branch of the merge template at
 * autonomy_level < 4.
 *
 * ## Why this test is currently skipped
 *
 * Same infra blockers as the other `post-approval-merge-*` tests:
 *   - Mock `gh` on PATH (needed to assert `gh pr merge` was NOT called).
 *   - LLM mock / recording for the reviewer agent.
 *   - Multi-turn conversation support so the human rejection reply is
 *     threaded back into the post-approval session.
 *   - Per-spec env override for
 *     `NEOKAI_TASK_AGENT_POST_APPROVAL_ROUTING`.
 *
 * See `post-approval-merge-autonomy-high.e2e.ts` for the full discussion.

			//    `mark_complete`. Task ends at `done`.
			// 8. Assert UI: task list row shows "done"; no merge happened.
