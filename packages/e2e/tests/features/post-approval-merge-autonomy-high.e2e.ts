/**
 * Post-Approval: Auto-merge at high autonomy (Level 4) E2E Tests
 *
 * PR 4/5 of
 * `docs/plans/remove-completion-actions-task-agent-as-post-approval-executor.md`
 * §4.6 requires this test: a Level-4 space running the built-in Coding
 * workflow against a fake PR must reach `approved`, the post-approval
 * reviewer session must spawn, run `gh pr merge --squash`, call
 * `mark_complete`, and the task must end at `done` with no human
 * interaction.
 *
 * ## Why this test is currently skipped
 *
 * Executing the full post-approval path end-to-end requires three pieces
 * of infrastructure that are NOT yet in place in the E2E harness:
 *
 *   1. **Mock `gh` CLI.** The post-approval reviewer session runs
 *      `gh pr view`, `gh pr merge --squash`, and `git pull --ff-only`.
 *      Without a sandboxed mock on `PATH`, the test would either hit
 *      GitHub.com (unacceptable — write side-effect) or abort with
 *      "gh: command not found". The plan (§4.6) calls out
 *      `tests/e2e/helpers/mock-gh.sh` as the intended shim.
 *
 *   2. **LLM mock / recording.** The reviewer session runs an LLM
 *      agent. Existing E2E tests avoid this by either marking tasks as
 *      `done` before the agent spawns, or by testing UI without
 *      spawning an agent at all. This test cannot short-circuit — the
 *      whole point is observing the agent's behaviour. A recording
 *      harness (VCR-style) or an `@neokai/provider/test` mock that
 *      feeds scripted tool-call responses is required.
 *
 *   3. **Feature flag parity.** PR 3/5 defaulted
 *      `NEOKAI_TASK_AGENT_POST_APPROVAL_ROUTING` to ON, but the E2E
 *      fixture does not yet surface environment-level controls for
 *      daemon-side flags — the dev-server is started once and the
 *      env is inherited. Adding a per-spec env override to
 *      `packages/e2e/fixtures.ts` is a blocker.
 *
 * Once (1)–(3) land, the test body below can be un-skipped. The steps
 * are authored inline for clarity so the reviewer of the follow-up PR
 * has a concrete target.

			// 8. Assert UI: no `PendingPostApprovalBanner` visible; task list
