/**
 * Task-pane banner precedence helper.
 *
 * Before PR 4/5 the task pane stacked four independent banners
 * (`PendingCompletionActionBanner`, `PendingTaskCompletionBanner`,
 * `PendingGateBanner`, `TaskBlockedBanner`) and let CSS stacking decide which
 * the user saw first. That produced ambiguous states — e.g. a blocked task
 * with a pending gate still rendered both bands, and the completion-action
 * banner (now deleted) could sit on top of the gate banner.
 *
 * `resolveActiveTaskBanner` collapses that into a single, deterministic
 * decision. Consumers render exactly one banner — the one this function
 * returns — so the UI matches the documented precedence rules in
 * `docs/plans/remove-completion-actions-task-agent-as-post-approval-executor.md`
 * §4.7.2.
 *
 * Precedence (first match wins):
 *   1. `task.status === 'blocked'`                                       → `blocked`
 *   2. `task.status === 'approved' && task.postApprovalBlockedReason`    → `post_approval_blocked`
 *   3. `task.pendingCheckpointType === 'task_completion'`                → `task_completion_pending`
 *   4. `task.workflowRunId` AND any gate is `waiting_human`              → `gate_pending`
 *   5. Otherwise                                                         → `null`
 *
 * Completion-action checkpoints (`pendingCheckpointType === 'completion_action'`)
 * are intentionally not in the precedence chain — the completion-action
 * pipeline was removed in this same PR, so any residual row with that value is
 * treated as noise and falls through to `null`.
 *
 * This file is purely derived from its inputs. No hub calls, no signals, no
 * side effects — safe to call inside render loops and unit tests.
