# Task 6 Investigation: Stuck Leader Analysis

**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Investigator:** Coder Agent
**Task:** Investigate why Task 6 "Validate and measure improvements" appeared stuck

## Summary

**Task 6 was NOT stuck - it was already successfully completed.**

The PR #264 was merged to the `dev` branch at `2026-03-08T14:00:04Z`.

## Investigation Findings

### PR #264 Status

- **State:** MERGED
- **Merged By:** lsm
- **Merge Commit:** `e1f1a6dd`
- **Reviews:** 2 reviews (both commented)

### What Was Accomplished in Task 6

1. **Problem Identified:** Proxy environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`) don't work because the Claude Agent SDK subprocess doesn't reliably inherit them.

2. **Solution Found:** Use `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to redirect SDK API calls to Dev Proxy. This is more reliable because:
   - SDK subprocess properly inherits `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
   - No proxy env var inheritance issues
   - Simpler configuration

3. **Test Results:** 4/4 tests pass with `NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY=1`

### Why It Appeared "Stuck"

The leader session was waiting for human review and approval of the PR. The PR received two code reviews documenting findings, and was then merged.

### Key Commits in PR #264

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `8250234` | Initial validation with TCP health check fix |
| `d557bee` | Updated validation report with SDK findings |
| `c91f2bd` | Added mock API server alternative |
| `125c4cf` | **Fix: Use ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL for Dev Proxy** |
| `291a1db` | Updated documentation |

## Conclusion

The Dev Proxy integration is working correctly with the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` approach. The task was completed successfully.

## Recommendations

1. The goal "use dev proxy for all online tests" can now be considered achieved
2. All 6 tasks in the goal are complete
3. Dev Proxy mode can be used in CI/CD with `NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY=1`
