# Task 6: Validate and Measure Improvements - Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

This task was to validate the Dev Proxy integration improvements. The validation was completed successfully in PR #264.

## Key Findings

### Problem Identified
Proxy environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`) don't work because the Claude Agent SDK subprocess doesn't reliably inherit them.

### Solution Found
Use `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to redirect SDK API calls to Dev Proxy. This approach works because:
1. SDK subprocess properly inherits `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
2. No proxy env var inheritance issues
3. Simpler configuration - just one environment variable

## Validation Results

| Mode | Status | Tests Passing |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Mock SDK (`NEOKAI_AGENT_SDK_MOCK=1`) | ✅ Working | 3/4 |
| Dev Proxy (`NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY=1`) | ✅ Working | 4/4 |
