# Milestone 4 — Worktree Path Shortening

## Goal

Shorten the worktree base directory path by replacing the full encoded repo path (e.g., `-Users-lsm-focus-dev-neokai`) with a short project key derived from the repo path. The git branch name remains unchanged. Existing worktrees continue to work via the old path; new worktrees use the shorter path.

## Context

Current worktree path format:
```
~/.neokai/projects/{full-encoded-repo-path}/worktrees/{safeSessionId}
```
Example:
```
/Users/lsm/.neokai/projects/-Users-lsm-focus-dev-neokai/worktrees/planner-04062505-...
```

The long encoded path comes from `WorktreeManager.encodeRepoPath()` in `packages/daemon/src/lib/worktree-manager.ts`. The `getWorktreeBaseDir()` method uses this encoding to produce the base directory.

Proposed short key: last path component of the repo root + first 8 characters of a deterministic hash of the full path. Example: `dev-neokai-a3b2c1d4`. This is human-readable, unique, and deterministic (same repo path always produces the same short key).

The `WorktreeManager` does not store anything in the DB — it operates purely on the filesystem. The path shortening is purely a filesystem naming change.

**Backward compatibility**: The old long path must still be recognized when checking if an existing session's worktree path is valid (`verifyWorktree`). Critically, `verifyWorktree` does **not** recompute the path from the repo root — it uses the `worktree_path` value already stored in the DB for that session record. Old session records store the old long path; `verifyWorktree` reads that stored value and checks it against the filesystem. As long as the directory still exists at the old path, old sessions continue to work with zero changes. New session records will store the new short path. Both formats coexist in the DB indefinitely with no conflict.

## Tasks

### Task 4.1 — Implement Project Short Key Generation in WorktreeManager

**Description**: Add a `getProjectShortKey(repoPath: string): string` method to `WorktreeManager` that produces a short, deterministic, human-readable directory name for a given repo path, and update `getWorktreeBaseDir` to use it.

**Subtasks**:
1. In `packages/daemon/src/lib/worktree-manager.ts`, add a private method `getProjectShortKey(repoPath: string): string`:
   - Extract the last component of the path: `basename(repoPath)` — e.g., `dev-neokai`
   - Compute a 8-character hex hash of the full normalized path using `Bun.hash()` or a simple djb2/FNV-1a hash (avoid importing crypto for this small utility)
   - Return `${lastComponent}-${hash8chars}` — e.g., `dev-neokai-a3b2c1d4`
   - Sanitize: replace characters invalid in directory names with `-` (keep alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
2. Update `getWorktreeBaseDir(gitRoot: string)` to call `getProjectShortKey(gitRoot)` instead of `encodeRepoPath(gitRoot)`, so new worktrees go into the short path
3. Keep `encodeRepoPath` — it is still used by `cleanupOrphanedWorktrees` to detect session worktrees (the `.includes('.neokai/projects')` check still works regardless of key format)
4. Write unit tests for `getProjectShortKey`:
   - Same path always returns the same key (deterministic)
   - Different paths return different keys (collision resistance via hash)
   - Output contains only safe filesystem characters
   - Output is shorter than the full encoded path

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `getProjectShortKey('/Users/alice/code/my-project')` returns a string like `my-project-a3b2c1d4`
- The key is deterministic — calling twice with the same input returns the same result
- New worktrees are created at `~/.neokai/projects/{shortKey}/worktrees/...`
- Old worktrees (with long paths) continue to work — `verifyWorktree` checks the `worktreePath` stored in DB, so existing records still point to the old path which still exists on disk
- Unit tests pass

**Depends on**: Milestone 1 complete (can run in parallel with Milestones 2–3)

**Agent type**: coder

**Branch/PR**: Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create` targeting `dev`.

### Task 4.2 — Update TEST_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR Handling and Integration Tests

**Description**: The `WorktreeManager` has a `TEST_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` environment variable override for tests. Ensure test infrastructure continues to work with the new short key. Also run the worktree manager unit tests and fix any failures.

**Subtasks**:
1. Run existing `WorktreeManager` unit tests (`cd packages/daemon && bun test tests/unit/worktree/`) and confirm they still pass after the `getWorktreeBaseDir` change
2. If tests use hardcoded path expectations that include the old encoded format, update them to use the new short key format
3. Add a unit test that verifies `getWorktreeBaseDir` with the new format still respects `TEST_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` when set
4. Add a unit test that verifies a worktree created with the old long path format is still recognized by `verifyWorktree` (simulate old-format path in the DB record)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All worktree unit tests pass
- The `TEST_WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` override still works correctly
- The transition test (old path format still valid in `verifyWorktree`) passes

**Depends on**: Task 4.1

**Agent type**: coder

**Branch/PR**: Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create` targeting `dev`.
