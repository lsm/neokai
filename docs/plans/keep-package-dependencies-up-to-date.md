# Keep Package Dependencies Up to Date

## Goal

Recurring mission to keep all package dependencies current and pinned to exact versions across the NeoKai monorepo. Each cycle checks for outdated packages, updates them (Claude Agent SDK separately, everything else together), and verifies nothing is broken.

## Approach

Each cycle runs three tasks in order:

1. **Check and update Claude Agent SDK** (separate PR) -- the SDK has special handling because it may include breaking changes that require code updates and type regeneration via `make sync-sdk-types`.
2. **Check and update all other dependencies** (single PR) -- all non-SDK dependencies across all workspace `package.json` files are updated together.
3. **Audit version pinning** -- ensure no `~` or `^` prefixes remain anywhere.

All PRs target the `dev` branch.

## Packages in Scope

- Root `package.json` -- devDependencies: `@biomejs/biome`, `@testing-library/preact`, `knip`, `oxlint`, `typescript`
- `packages/cli/package.json` -- deps: `hono`, `vite`; devDeps: `@types/bun`, `playwright`, `v8-to-istanbul`
- `packages/daemon/package.json` -- deps: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, `@github/copilot-sdk`, `croner`, `simple-git`, `zod`; devDeps: `@types/bun`
- `packages/shared/package.json` -- devDeps: `@types/bun`
- `packages/web/package.json` -- deps: `@preact/signals`, `clsx`, `highlight.js`, `marked`, `preact`; devDeps: `@preact/preset-vite`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `@testing-library/preact`, `@types/bun`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `@vitest/ui`, `happy-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `typescript`, `vite`, `vitest`
- `packages/ui/package.json` -- deps: `@floating-ui/dom`, `preact`; devDeps: `@preact/preset-vite`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `@testing-library/preact`, `@types/bun`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `happy-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `vite`, `vitest`
- `packages/e2e/package.json` -- devDeps: `@playwright/test`, `@types/node`, `monocart-reporter`

## Task 1: Update Claude Agent SDK

**Type:** coder

**Description:**
Check if `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` has a newer version than the currently pinned version. If yes, update it, regenerate SDK types, fix any breaking changes, and run tests.

**Subtasks:**
1. Run `bun install` at the worktree root to install all dependencies.
2. Check the current pinned version of `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` in `packages/daemon/package.json` (currently `0.2.81`).
3. Check the latest published version:
   ```bash
   bun npm info @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk version
   ```
4. If no newer version exists, report "SDK is up to date" and stop. The task is complete.
5. If a newer version exists, update `packages/daemon/package.json` to the new exact version (no `^` or `~`).
6. Run `bun install` to update the lockfile.
7. Run `make sync-sdk-types` to regenerate types from the new SDK version.
8. Check for TypeScript compilation errors:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```
9. If there are breaking changes (type errors, removed APIs, changed signatures), update the codebase to fix them. Search for usages of changed APIs in `packages/daemon/src/` and `packages/shared/src/`.
10. Run the daemon unit tests to verify nothing is broken:
    ```bash
    make test-daemon
    ```
11. Run the web tests:
    ```bash
    make test-web
    ```
12. Run lint and format checks:
    ```bash
    bun run check
    ```
13. Create a feature branch, commit, push, and create a PR targeting `dev` via `gh pr create`. PR title should be: `chore(deps): update @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk to <version>`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is updated to the latest version with an exact pin (no `^` or `~`).
- `make sync-sdk-types` has been run and generated types are committed.
- All breaking changes are resolved -- `bun run typecheck` passes.
- `make test-daemon` and `make test-web` pass.
- `bun run check` (lint + typecheck + knip) passes.
- Changes are on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create` targeting `dev`.

**Dependencies:** none

## Task 2: Update All Other Dependencies

**Type:** coder

**Description:**
Update all non-SDK dependencies across all workspace `package.json` files to their latest stable versions. All updates go into a single PR.

**Subtasks:**
1. Run `bun install` at the worktree root.
2. Check for outdated packages across the monorepo. For each `package.json`, compare pinned versions against latest:
   ```bash
   bun outdated
   ```
   Or check individually for packages where `bun outdated` does not cover workspaces:
   ```bash
   cd packages/daemon && bun outdated
   cd packages/web && bun outdated
   cd packages/cli && bun outdated
   cd packages/e2e && bun outdated
   cd packages/ui && bun outdated
   cd packages/shared && bun outdated
   ```
3. If all packages are up to date, report "All dependencies are current" and stop.
4. For each outdated package, update the version in the relevant `package.json` to the latest stable version. Use exact versions only (no `^` or `~`). Do NOT update `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` -- that is handled in Task 1.
5. When updating shared dependencies that appear in multiple packages (e.g., `preact`, `vite`, `@types/bun`, `tailwindcss`, `vitest`, `typescript`), ensure all packages use the same version.
6. Run `bun install` to update the lockfile.
7. Run typecheck:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```
8. Fix any type errors caused by dependency updates.
9. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   make test-daemon
   make test-web
   ```
10. Run lint and format checks:
    ```bash
    bun run check
    ```
11. If any tests fail due to API changes in updated dependencies, fix the code to work with the new versions.
12. Create a feature branch, commit, push, and create a PR targeting `dev` via `gh pr create`. PR title should be: `chore(deps): update all dependencies`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All non-SDK dependencies are updated to latest stable versions with exact pins.
- Shared dependencies (e.g., `preact`, `vite`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `vitest`, `@types/bun`) are consistent across all workspace packages.
- `bun run typecheck` passes.
- `make test-daemon` and `make test-web` pass.
- `bun run check` (lint + typecheck + knip) passes.
- Changes are on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create` targeting `dev`.

**Dependencies:** none (can run in parallel with Task 1, but should not include SDK changes)

## Task 3: Audit and Enforce Exact Version Pins

**Type:** general

**Description:**
Verify that all dependency versions across every `package.json` in the monorepo are exact (no `~` or `^` prefixes). This task runs after Tasks 1 and 2 to catch any range specifiers that may have been introduced.

**Subtasks:**
1. Search all `package.json` files for version strings with `~` or `^` prefixes:
   ```bash
   grep -rn '[\"\x27]\(\^\|~\)[0-9]' packages/*/package.json package.json
   ```
2. If any are found, report which packages and dependencies have range specifiers.
3. If Task 1 or Task 2 PRs are still open, request amendments to fix the pinning in those PRs.
4. If the range specifiers exist in already-merged code, create a coder task to remove them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All `package.json` files across the monorepo use exact version pins (no `~` or `^`).
- Any violations are either fixed in the open PRs from Tasks 1/2 or flagged for a follow-up fix.

**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 2
