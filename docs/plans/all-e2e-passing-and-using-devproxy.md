# Plan: All E2E Passing and Using DevProxy

## Goal

Get all e2e tests passing using devproxy where LLM is needed. This improves test stability, reduces cost, and eliminates flakiness from real API calls.

## Background

The CI already separates e2e tests into two categories:
- **no_llm**: UI-only tests that don't require LLM API calls
- **llm**: Tests that send messages and wait for LLM responses

Currently, the LLM tests use real `GLM_API_KEY` in CI, which can be flaky and costly. The goal is to convert these to use devproxy like the daemon online tests do.

### Categorization Methodology

Tests are categorized in CI's `discover` job (main.yml lines 620-680) using a hardcoded list of LLM tests. All other tests are considered no-LLM. This categorization is based on whether the test sends a message and waits for an LLM response.

## Current Test Categories (from CI discover step)

### LLM Tests (currently use real API)
- core/message-flow
- core/interrupt-button
- core/interrupt-error-bug
- core/context-features
- features/archive
- features/file-operations

## Tasks

### Phase 0: Baseline (Run tests to identify current failures)

#### Task 0: Run no-LLM tests to establish baseline (COMPLETED)
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Run all no-LLM e2e tests against the current binary to identify which tests are currently failing. Document the failures as the baseline, categorized by root cause: real bugs, flaky tests, or out-of-date assertions.
**Status:** COMPLETED - Baseline established via CI run on dev branch (https://github.com/lsm/neokai/actions/runs/22868755618)
**Results:**
- 7 tests failing (see Baseline Test Results section)
- 24 tests passing
- 8 LLM tests passing with real GLM API
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ List of currently failing no-LLM tests documented
- ✅ Failure reasons categorized: real bugs, flaky tests, or out-of-date assertions
- ✅ Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

### Phase 1: Fix No-LLM E2E Tests

#### Task 1: Fix 7 failing no-LLM e2e tests
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Fix the 7 failing no-LLM e2e tests identified in the baseline. Each test should be fixed individually and verified. Document root cause for each failure.
**Failing tests (from baseline):**
1. core-navigation-3-column
2. read-only-home
3. read-only-ui-components
4. features-thinking-level-selector
5. serial-error-scenarios
6. settings-settings-modal
7. serial-auth-error-scenarios

**Root cause analysis (to be determined during implementation):**
- Download artifacts to identify root cause: `gh run download 22868755618 -n e2e-results-[test-name]`
- Common root causes:
  - **Real bugs**: Actual application issues that need fixing in source code
  - **Flaky tests**: Timing-dependent tests that occasionally fail
  - **Out-of-date assertions**: Tests expecting old UI patterns
  - **Missing elements**: UI changes breaking selectors

**Method:**
- Download artifacts to see failure details for each test
- Run each failing test individually to debug: `make run-e2e TEST=tests/[path].e2e.ts`
- Categorize each failure: real bug, flaky, or assertion issue
- Fix each test one by one, running locally to verify before marking complete
- Document root cause for each failure
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 7 failing no-LLM tests pass when run against the binary
- Each fix verified individually before moving to next
- Root cause documented for each failing test
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 2: Update CI job name from "e2e" to "e2e-no-llm"
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the CI workflow job name from "e2e" to "e2e-no-llm" to clearly communicate that these are UI-only tests. Also update related artifact names and documentation.
**Specific changes:**
- Rename job: `e2e` → `e2e-no-llm` (lines 687-776 in main.yml)
- Update artifact names: `e2e-results-*` → `e2e-no-llm-results-*`
- Update job display name: `E2E (${{ matrix.test.name }})` → `E2E No-LLM (${{ matrix.test.name }})`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CI job renamed to "e2e-no-llm" in main.yml
- All references updated (artifacts, display names)
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

### Phase 2: Convert LLM Tests to Use DevProxy

#### Task 3: Configure devproxy for e2e-llm job in CI
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the CI workflow for the `e2e-llm` job (main.yml lines 783-874) to start devproxy before running tests and configure the binary to use the devproxy URL. This mirrors how daemon online tests are configured in `main.yml` lines 263-300.
**Specific changes:**
1. Add "Install Dev Proxy" step to e2e-llm job (similar to daemon online tests)
2. Add "Start Dev Proxy" step before tests run
3. Set environment variables:
   - `NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY=1` (enables devproxy mode)
   - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-devproxy-test-key`
   - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=""` (clear any real token)
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=""` (clear any real token)
4. Add "Stop Dev Proxy" step in `if: always()` to cleanup
**Reference:** See daemon online test configuration in `main.yml` lines 263-314
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Devproxy is installed and started in e2e-llm job before tests run
- Binary is configured to use devproxy via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY=1
- Devproxy is stopped after tests complete
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4a: Update core/message-flow.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. The mock returns "[MOCKED] Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant." - test assertions need to be updated to accept any response or check for "[MOCKED]" prefix.
**Current behavior:** Test sends "Reply with exactly: TEST_OK" and expects that exact response
**Mock behavior:** Returns canned "[MOCKED] Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant."
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check at top: `const IS_MOCK = !!process.env.NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY;`
- Update line 63 assertion from:
  ```javascript
  await expect(page.locator('text=/TEST_OK|test_ok/i')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 60000 });
  ```
  To:
  ```javascript
  if (IS_MOCK) {
    // Just verify any assistant message appears
    await expect(page.locator('[data-message-role="assistant"]').first()).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });
  } else {
    await expect(page.locator('text=/TEST_OK|test_ok/i')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 60000 });
  }
  ```
- Similarly update any other test cases in this file that expect specific LLM responses
**Reference:** See `packages/daemon/tests/online/convo/multiturn-conversation.test.ts` for IS_MOCK pattern
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Assertions updated to accept mock responses - verify any assistant message visible instead of specific text
- Test passes with devproxy running
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4b: Update core/interrupt-button.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Note: interrupt tests rely on timing - mock responses return instantly, so test timing assertions may need adjustment.
**Current behavior:** Tests send messages like "Write a detailed essay about quantum computing" and verify stop button appears/can be clicked during processing
**Mock behavior:** Returns instantly (milliseconds vs seconds for real API), so processing window is very short
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check at top: `const IS_MOCK = !!process.env.NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY;`
- Key timing issues:
  - Line 38: `await page.waitForTimeout(1000)` - reduce to `100` in mock mode
  - Line 65: `await page.waitForTimeout(1000)` - reduce to `100` in mock mode
  - Line 90: `await page.waitForTimeout(1000)` - reduce to `100` in mock mode
  - Line 178: `await page.waitForTimeout(1000)` - reduce to `100` in mock mode
  - Line 188: `await page.waitForTimeout(2000)` - reduce to `200` in mock mode
- Use conditional timing:
  ```javascript
  const waitTime = IS_MOCK ? 100 : 1000;
  await page.waitForTimeout(waitTime);
  ```
- Alternatively: The tests verify button state transitions - with instant mock, we just need to verify the transition happens at all, not the timing
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Timing adjusted: reduce waitForTimeout from 1000ms to 100ms in mock mode
- Test passes with devproxy running
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4c: Update core/interrupt-error-bug.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. This is a fixme test that documents a race condition bug - with instant mock responses, the race condition behavior may differ from real API.
**Current behavior:** Test marked with `test.fixme()` - expects race condition bug to exist (line 32: `test.fixme('should allow sending messages immediately after interrupt without reset'...`)
**Mock behavior:** Returns instantly, so the race condition may not manifest the same way
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check at top: `const IS_MOCK = !!process.env.NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY;`
- In mock mode, the test should likely be skipped or have different assertions because:
  - The bug being tested (race condition requiring reset) depends on slow API responses
  - With instant mock, the race doesn't occur the same way
- Recommended approach:
  ```javascript
  test.fixme(IS_MOCK, 'Race condition bug not reproducible with instant mock responses');
  test('should allow sending messages immediately after interrupt without reset', async ({ page }) => {
    // existing test code
  });
  ```
- The test will remain as fixme in both modes, but for different reasons:
  - Real API: bug exists
  - Mock API: race condition not reproducible
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Test appropriately skips/notes that race condition isn't testable with mocks
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4d: Update core/context-features.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Tests use `waitForAssistantResponse` helper and check for context data.
**Current behavior:** Tests send messages and verify context usage indicator works. Many tests use `test.skip()` if provider doesn't report context data.
**Mock behavior:** Devproxy mock DOES include usage data (verified):
```json
{
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 50,
    "output_tokens": 20,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 0,
    "service_tier": "standard"
  }
}
```
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check at top: `const IS_MOCK = !!process.env.NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY;`
- Verify mock returns usage data by checking `.devproxy/devproxy.log` after test run
- The `waitForContextData()` helper already handles missing context data gracefully
- In mock mode: the tests should PASS because mock includes usage data
- If any tests fail: may need to adjust the helper or add IS_MOCK awareness
**Reference:** See `.devproxy/mocks.json` lines 46-52 and 104-111 for mock usage data
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Context assertions work with mock response usage data (verified: mock includes usage)
- Test passes with devproxy running - no skips needed in mock mode
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4e: Update features/archive.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Tests use `createSessionWithMessage` helper which sends "Hello, say 'test message acknowledged'" and waits for response.
**Current behavior:** Creates session, sends message, waits for response, then tests archive UI
**Mock behavior:** Returns canned "[MOCKED]" response
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check
- Change `createSessionWithMessage` to accept any response in mock mode, or update test assertions to accept "[MOCKED]"
**Reference:** Helper is in `packages/e2e/tests/helpers/session-archive-helpers.ts`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Session creation works with mock responses
- Archive UI tests still pass
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4f: Update features/file-operations.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Tests ask Claude to read/list files and verify response contains content.
**Current behavior:** Sends "What is in the package.json file?" and expects substantive response with file content
**Mock behavior:** Returns "[MOCKED] Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant." - no actual file content
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check
- Change assertions to verify any assistant response appears, not specific file content
- Example: instead of `expect(content!.length).toBeGreaterThan(10)`, just verify message is visible
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Assertions updated to accept mock responses (any message visible)
- Test passes with devproxy running
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4g: Update features/rewind-features.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Tests send multiple messages and use rewind functionality.
**Current behavior:** Sends messages like "Tell me about Python", waits for response, then tests rewind UI
**Mock behavior:** Returns canned "[MOCKED]" response
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check
- Update `sendMessage` helper or test assertions to accept mock responses
- Verify rewind UI works regardless of response content
**Reference:** Helper is in `packages/e2e/tests/helpers/wait-helpers.ts`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- Rewind functionality tests work with mock responses
- Test passes with devproxy running
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 4h: Update settings/auto-title.e2e.ts to use devproxy
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Update the test to handle devproxy mock responses. Tests verify auto-title generation after message exchange.
**Current behavior:** Sends "What is the capital of France?" and expects title to change from "New Session" to something else based on LLM response
**Mock behavior:** Returns "[MOCKED] Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant." - won't generate meaningful title
**Required changes:**
- Add IS_MOCK check
- In mock mode: verify title generation is triggered (API called) but skip assertion on specific title content
- OR: Update mock to include title in response metadata (if supported)
- Mock will return same response for every message, so title may be generic or may not change
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test detects mock mode via IS_MOCK environment variable
- In mock mode: verify API was called (title generation triggered) but skip specific title assertions
- Test passes with devproxy running
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

#### Task 5: Verify all e2e tests pass in CI
**Agent:** coder
**Description:** Run the full e2e test suite in CI to ensure everything passes. This is the final validation before completion. Note: LLM tests already passed with real GLM API in baseline run - this task verifies they still pass after no-LLM fixes and with devproxy configured.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All 31 no-LLM tests pass in CI
- All 8 LLM tests pass in CI (with devproxy configured in Task 3)
- CI workflow "All Tests Pass" gate succeeds
- Changes must be on a feature branch with a GitHub PR created via `gh pr create`

## Dependencies

- Task 0 must complete first (establish baseline)
- Task 1 depends on Task 0 (fix identified failures)
- Task 2 can proceed independently after Task 1
- Task 3 must complete before Tasks 4a-4h (infrastructure ready)
- Task 4a-4h are sequential (one test at a time as requested)
- Task 5 requires Tasks 1-4h to complete

## Notes

- **Baseline results:** LLM tests (8/8) passed with real GLM API in baseline CI run - goal is to convert to devproxy for stability/cost
- **IS_MOCK pattern reference:** Daemon tests use `const IS_MOCK = !!process.env.NEOKAI_USE_DEV_PROXY;` to detect mock mode
- **Mock response content:** Devproxy returns "[MOCKED] Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant." - tests expecting specific responses need updating
- **Interrupt tests:** Mock responses return instantly - interrupt tests need timing adjustments
- **CI job naming:** "e2e" → "e2e-no-llm" and "e2e-llm" remains as-is (already descriptive)
- **waitForAssistantResponse helper:** Located in `packages/e2e/tests/helpers/wait-helpers.ts` - counts assistant messages before/after to detect response
