## 0. Executive summary

The research doc argues (and this plan accepts) that the `completionActions`
system should be **removed entirely**. The original revision of this plan
proposed replacing it with a narrow `merge_pr` MCP tool on the Task Agent.
That approach was reconsidered after initial review:

- Real-world post-approval work (merge a PR, deploy, publish a package, …) is
  rarely a one-shot shell command. It involves waiting on CI, handling
  conflicts, retrying on transient failures, and deciding when to escalate to
  a human. A rigid handler cannot do this well; it needs **LLM dynamic
  processing**.
- Post-approval actions are **per-workflow**, not per-daemon. The workflow
  template knows its own domain (coding-with-PRs vs. research-with-docs vs.
  plan-and-decompose). Hardcoding "merge_pr" as a daemon-level primitive
  leaks workflow-specific knowledge into the runtime.
- The Task Agent's "orchestrator, never executor" contract should stay
  intact. Adding any executor tool to it (narrow or otherwise) erodes the
  contract and makes future requests ("can Task Agent also deploy?") harder
  to refuse.

**The revised approach is workflow-declared, runtime-dispatched post-approval
agent routing.** In one sentence: a workflow template declares
`postApproval.targetAgent` (an agent role that is part of the same workflow,
or `task-agent`) and `postApproval.instructions` (a templated prompt). After
the end node signals completion, the **runtime** transitions the task to a
new `approved` status and dispatches deterministically — spawning a fresh
session for the target agent with interpolated instructions, or (when the
target is `task-agent`) injecting an instruction turn into the existing Task
Agent conversation. When post-approval completes, the task transitions to
`done`. The target agent is a normal space task node agent session with its normal
toolkit (Bash, file ops, MCP servers, everything), so it can handle merge
complexity the same way any other node handles its work — with LLM
judgement, retries, and escalation.

Concretely:

1. New workflow schema field `postApproval: { targetAgent, instructions }` —
   `targetAgent` must be either a declared agent role in the same workflow or
   the literal string `task-agent`. `instructions` is a templated string
   (`{{pr_url}}`, `{{autonomy_level}}`, `{{reviewer_name}}`, …) evaluated at
   routing time.
2. End nodes still signal post-approval intent via a structured `send_message`
   to `task-agent` (with `data: { pr_url, post_approval_action: 'merge_pr' }`
   or any other domain-specific key) and **then** call `approve_task()` /
   `submit_for_approval()` exactly as today. This payload survives as the
   template's data source — `{{pr_url}}` comes from there.
3. New task status value **`approved`**. Lifecycle becomes
   `open → in_progress → review? → approved → done` (the `review` branch is
   unchanged from today). The runtime transitions the task to `approved`
   when an end node closes it; it transitions to `done` once post-approval
   completes.
4. A new runtime module, `PostApprovalRouter`, performs the dispatch on the
   `approved` boundary — *not* the Task Agent LLM. The dispatch is a
   deterministic lookup against `workflow.postApproval`:
   - If the workflow has no `postApproval` → immediately transition to `done`
     (single-step workflows, documentation missions).
   - If `targetAgent` is a **space task node agent** (an agent role declared
     on a node in this workflow — see code-comment convention below) →
     spawn a new session for that agent with the interpolated `instructions`
     as kickoff. The agent calls a new `mark_complete` tool when finished,
     transitioning `approved → done`.
   - If `targetAgent === 'task-agent'` → inject
     `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` as a user turn into the existing Task
     Agent session. The Task Agent performs the work with its orchestrator
     toolset and calls `mark_complete` when done — same tool as above.
5. The spawned post-approval session is a normal space task node agent session: it
   has the agent's full system prompt, tool surface, and MCP servers. For a
   PR merge, the instructions direct it to run the appropriate shell
   commands (`gh pr view`, `gh pr merge`, worktree sync). For a different
   workflow's post-approval it could be publishing a release, notifying
   slack, etc. — all determined by the workflow author's instruction string.
6. **One new MCP tool on the Task Agent server: `mark_complete`.** Routing
   itself is deterministic runtime code — no LLM tool-call gates the
   dispatch. But the `approved → done` transition needs an explicit signal
   from the agent doing the post-approval work (whether that's a spawned
   space task node agent or the Task Agent itself when `targetAgent === 'task-agent'`).
   `mark_complete` takes no args and only succeeds on an `approved` task;
   calling it transitions the task to `done`. It's deliberately distinct
   from `approve_task` — overloading one tool across both the
   "work-quality approval" transition (`in_progress → approved`) and the
   "post-approval done" transition (`approved → done`) would confuse
   callers about what the tool means in context.
7. The entire `CompletionAction` type, its runtime pipeline, its RPC
   intercepts, its MCP tool (`approve_completion_action`), its DB columns,
   and its UI surface are deleted. The per-workflow knob
   `completionAutonomyLevel` **stays** (it controls `approve_task` vs
   `submit_for_approval` at the *work-is-good* level, orthogonal to the
   post-approval step).

This resolves Gaps #1, #2, #3 from the research doc in one move, eliminates
the failure modes catalogued in §10 of that doc, and produces a single
unified approval UX — without introducing new executor primitives into the
Task Agent or daemon.

### Prioritized implementation order

| Stage | PR | Scope | Dependency |
|------|----|-------|------------|
| 1 | Task state `approved` + workflow schema | Add `TaskStatus='approved'` (shared types + DB migration), add `WorkflowDefinition.postApproval` shape + validator, no behaviour change yet (nothing reads `approved` or `postApproval` beyond load/save). Unit-tested. | — |
| 2 | Runtime post-approval routing | New `PostApprovalRouter` module dispatches on the `approved` boundary: no-target → direct `done`; space-task-node-agent target → spawn session; `task-agent` target → inject `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` turn. New `mark_complete` MCP tool (Task Agent + spawned post-approval sessions) gates the `approved → done` transition; `approve_task` stays scoped to `in_progress → approved`. Runtime emits `[TASK_APPROVED]` as an awareness-only event. Behind a feature flag so callers continue seeing completion-actions behaviour until workflow templates migrate. | Stage 1 deployed |
| 3 | End-node handoff + built-in workflow `postApproval` entries | Update built-in workflow prompts to `send_message` to `task-agent` with `{ pr_url, post_approval_action }` before `approve_task`. Populate `postApproval` on all 5 built-in workflows. Update Task Agent system prompt + kickoff. Flip the feature flag. | Stage 2 deployed |
| 4 | Remove completion-action runtime pipeline | Delete `resolveCompletionWithActions` / `resumeCompletionActions` / `executeCompletionAction`; delete the `spaceTask.update` intercept for `completion_action`; delete `approve_completion_action` MCP tool; delete `PendingCompletionActionBanner`. Task/run completion now flows through the new `approved → done` path. | Stage 3 deployed |
| 5 | Schema cleanup + docs | Drop `pending_action_index`, `pending_checkpoint_type='completion_action'` value, `completion_actions_fired_at`, `MERGE_PR_COMPLETION_ACTION` etc. from DB & shared types. Docs refresh. Changelog. | Stage 4 merged |

Stages 4 + 5 can reasonably ship as one PR if the diff is still reviewable;
separating them keeps the migration safer.

## 1. Post-approval agent routing

### 1.1 Workflow schema: `postApproval`

New optional field on `WorkflowDefinition` (shared type):

```ts
interface PostApprovalRoute {
    /**
     * Agent role that runs post-approval work. Must be one of:
     *   - An agent name declared on a node in THIS workflow (e.g. "reviewer",
     *     "coder", "qa"). Post-approval spawns a fresh session for that role
     *     with the same config as a workflow-node session (same tool surface,
     *     same MCP servers, same worktree), independent of any previous
     *     execution.
     *   - The literal string "task-agent". Post-approval runs in the Task
     *     Agent's own session — used only when no space task node agent
     *     is appropriate and the Task Agent's orchestrator-tool surface
     *     is sufficient.
     * Validation runs at workflow save + load time; see §1.5.
     */
    targetAgent: string;

    /**
     * Templated user-message prompt delivered to the target agent's new
     * session as its kickoff input. Template variables are interpolated from
     * the signalled data and space state at routing time; see §1.6 for the
     * template grammar.
     *
     * Example:
     *   "The task has been approved. Merge the PR at {{pr_url}}.
     *    Space autonomy level: {{autonomy_level}}.
     *    - If autonomy >= 4, merge directly. Sync your worktree after.
     *    - Otherwise, call request_human_input to confirm, then merge.
     *    Verify CI status first (gh pr checks). On conflicts, rebase and
     *    retry. Escalate to the user via request_human_input if you get
     *    stuck."
     */
    instructions: string;
}

interface WorkflowDefinition {
    // ... existing fields
    postApproval?: PostApprovalRoute;
}
```

Rules:

- **Optional.** Workflows without a `postApproval` field transition directly
  from `approved → done` with no routing. Applies to workflows whose
  real-world lifecycle has no after-approval step (documentation, research,
  plan-and-decompose).
- **Single target per workflow.** No fan-out, no fallback chain. If a
  workflow needs both "merge PR" and "notify slack" the authors compose them
  inside `instructions`: the single target agent runs the combined flow
  step-by-step.
- **No dedicated tool surface.** The target agent's session is started with
  the same tool surface as if it were running a workflow node. No
  post-approval-specific MCP tools or Bash carve-outs.

### 1.2 Why a post-approval agent, not a dedicated MCP tool

(This section replaces the original revision's §1.2 "Why a dedicated tool,
not generic Bash". The argument flipped after the initial review: the
deterministic handler was too rigid for real-world merges.)

The Task Agent's system prompt declares it an orchestrator, not an executor.
Holding that line is valuable for three reasons, all of which push against
adding even a narrow executor tool like `merge_pr`:

1. **Merging a PR is not a one-shot shell command.** It requires waiting on
   CI, resolving conflicts, retrying on transient GitHub 500s, and deciding
   when to escalate to a human. A `Bun.spawn` handler with a fixed bash
   script has no decision surface for any of this; it either succeeds in one
   attempt or returns a stderr blob. LLM-dynamic handling is the natural fit.

2. **Post-approval work is workflow-specific.** A coding workflow merges a
   PR. A release workflow cuts a tag and publishes. A docs workflow might
   open a downstream docs-site PR. Encoding any one of these as a daemon
   primitive leaks the workflow's domain into the runtime and invites
   `deploy_service`, `publish_package`, `notify_oncall` as follow-up
   primitives. Workflow authors already write the rest of their workflow in
   prompts — let them write post-approval the same way.

3. **The orchestrator contract is a narrow interface worth keeping.** The
   Task Agent's value is that it is predictable: it tracks tasks, routes
   messages, requests human input, spawns agents. Every executor tool added
   to its MCP server enlarges its surface area and makes its behaviour
   harder to reason about. Routing to a purpose-built agent session keeps
   the Task Agent thin.

**Tradeoff accepted:** the post-approval agent session has a full toolkit
(Bash, filesystem, MCP) — much broader than a dedicated `merge_pr` handler.
This is fine because: (a) workflow-node sessions already have it, so we are
not granting a new privilege — we are reusing an existing one; (b) the
session is short-lived and scoped to the task at hand; (c) the autonomy
level and instruction template bound what the agent does in practice
(§3).

### 1.3 New task status: `approved`

Add `'approved'` to the `TaskStatus` union (shared type) and to the DB
`space_tasks.status` CHECK constraint. The full set becomes:

```
open | in_progress | review | approved | done | blocked | cancelled | archived
```

Semantics:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `in_progress` | A workflow node is actively working. |
| `review` | The end node returned `submit_for_approval`; a human must approve (or reject) before the task can close. Unchanged. |
| **`approved` (new)** | The work has been accepted (by the end node via `approve_task`, or by a human via `approvePendingCompletion`). **Post-approval is now pending.** The runtime (`PostApprovalRouter`) reads `workflow.postApproval` and dispatches. |
| `done` | Terminal success. Reached from `approved` once the post-approval session completes (or immediately if the workflow has no `postApproval`). |
| `blocked` | Terminal failure or human intervention required. |
| `cancelled` | User cancelled. |
| `archived` | Moved out of active views. |

Transitions relevant to this plan:

```
in_progress --approve_task()--> approved
in_progress --submit_for_approval()--> review
review --approve (human)--> approved
approved --no postApproval--> done
approved --postApproval session completed--> done
approved --postApproval session failed after retries--> blocked
```

**DB migration:**

- Extend the `status` CHECK constraint on `space_tasks` to include
  `'approved'`. Uses the table-rebuild pattern (SQLite cannot alter a CHECK
  constraint in place).
- Add a new column `space_tasks.post_approval_session_id TEXT NULL` that
  records the sub-session spawned for post-approval. Nullable because many
  tasks won't have one.
- Add a new column `space_tasks.post_approval_started_at INTEGER NULL` for
  audit / observability.

No backfill required: existing tasks are all in terminal or in-flight
statuses that don't include `approved`.

### 1.4 Runtime-driven routing mechanics

**Design decision (2026-04-23 revision):** routing is a deterministic
runtime step, not an LLM decision. The Task Agent is *not* in the critical
path for spawning the post-approval session — it only observes the
transitions for conversational awareness. **One** new MCP tool is added:
`mark_complete`, used by whichever agent performs the post-approval work
(a spawned space task node agent, or the Task Agent itself when
`targetAgent === 'task-agent'`) to signal `approved → done`.

> **Terminology — "space task node agent".** Throughout this plan,
> "space task node agent" refers to an agent session spawned for a node
> in a space workflow run — distinct from the Task Agent (the
> orchestrator) and from ad-hoc chat sessions. In the current codebase
> this is the `'node_agent'` kind in
> `packages/shared/src/types/space.ts` (`SpaceMemberSession.kind`). When
> the new `post-approval-router.ts` module is added, its doc comment
> will introduce the full term and cross-reference the existing
> `'node_agent'` kind so future readers can follow the vocabulary.

Four event sites interact:

1. **End-node `approve_task` completes.** Today this flows through the
   completion-action pipeline. New behaviour:
   - `SpaceRuntime` transitions the task from `in_progress → approved`
     (instead of the current `in_progress → pending_completion_action → done`).
   - Calls a new helper `PostApprovalRouter.route(task, workflow, context)`
     which performs the steps in (3) below.
   - Emits a `[TASK_APPROVED]` runtime event to the Task Agent session for
     conversational awareness only (so the orchestrator can answer user
     questions like "what happened to task 12?"). The Task Agent takes no
     action in response to this event.

2. **`approvePendingCompletion` (the human-approves-the-work path).**
   Transitions the task `review → approved` instead of today's `review → done`
   (or the completion-action branch). Calls `PostApprovalRouter.route` the
   same way.

3. **`PostApprovalRouter.route` — the deterministic dispatch.** Looks up
   `workflow.postApproval` and branches:

   - **If no `postApproval`:** runtime transitions `approved → done`
     directly via the task repository. Emits
     `task.status-transition: approved → done source=no-post-approval`.
     Done.

   - **If `postApproval.targetAgent === 'task-agent'`:** runtime injects
     the interpolated `instructions` as a user-message turn into the
     existing Task Agent session (same channel the runtime already uses
     for `[TASK_APPROVED]` and `[NODE_COMPLETE]` events; see
     `task-agent-manager.ts` ≈ line 2878). No session spawn. The Task
     Agent acts on the instructions using the tools already on its MCP
     server (`send_message`, `request_human_input`, `save_artifact`,
     etc.) plus the new `mark_complete` tool. Completion is signalled
     when the Task Agent calls `mark_complete` — which transitions
     `approved → done` (see §3.2).

   - **Otherwise (targetAgent is a space task node agent):** runtime
     spawns a fresh session for that agent:
     - Session kind: reuses the existing `space_task_agent` sub-session
       model (DB row with `kind = 'node_agent'`) with an
       `isPostApproval: true` flag (confirmed decision — §7.1).
     - Same worktree and MCP server config as the corresponding
       workflow-node session would have.
     - Kickoff user message = interpolated `instructions`.
     - Records `post_approval_session_id` + `post_approval_started_at` on
       the task.
     - The `mark_complete` tool is also available on this session's MCP
       surface (mirrored from the Task Agent's), so the agent can close
       the task directly when its work is done.

4. **Post-approval session completes (non-task-agent path).** The spawned
   space task node agent either calls `mark_complete` explicitly
   (preferred), or the runtime falls back to observing session termination
   as an implicit completion signal and transitions `approved → done`
   itself. Either way, no confusion between "approve the work" and "mark
   the post-approval complete" — the tool names are distinct.

5. **Post-approval session fails.** If the session exits with an error, or
   the spawned agent calls `submit_for_approval` on its post-approval work
   (escalating to a human), the task stays in `approved` with a
   `postApprovalBlockedReason` recorded. The user sees a
   `PendingPostApprovalBanner` driven by the session outcome (see §3.5).
   They can inspect the session transcript, fix the issue externally, and
   either retry or manually close.

**Why runtime-driven, not LLM-driven?** Routing is a fixed lookup against
`workflow.postApproval` — there is no decision for an LLM to make. Adding
an MCP tool for the Task Agent to "decide" to spawn would put deterministic
dispatch behind a non-deterministic gate, risking the Task Agent skipping
or mis-routing. The LLM's judgement is still fully present in the
post-approval *work itself* (performed by the target agent reading the
interpolated instructions); just not in the dispatch trigger.

### 1.5 Eligible target agents + validation

`targetAgent` must resolve at workflow save/load time. The validator:

```ts
function validatePostApproval(
    wf: WorkflowDefinition
): PostApprovalValidationResult {
    if (!wf.postApproval) return { ok: true };
    const { targetAgent } = wf.postApproval;
    if (targetAgent === 'task-agent') return { ok: true };
    const workflowAgents = new Set(
        wf.nodes.flatMap((n) => n.agents.map((a) => a.name))
    );
    if (workflowAgents.has(targetAgent)) return { ok: true };
    return {
        ok: false,
        error: `postApproval.targetAgent "${targetAgent}" is not a declared agent on this workflow and is not "task-agent". Eligible: ${[...workflowAgents, 'task-agent'].join(', ')}.`,
    };
}
```

Runs in `SpaceWorkflowManager.create` and `.update`, and on load from DB in
`SpaceWorkflowManager.get` (surfaces as a validator warning — workflow loads
but `postApproval` is disabled for that run until fixed, to protect against
stale configs after a node removal).

**Why restrict to declared space task node agents + task-agent?** Any
other target would require inventing a new agent role with ad-hoc config.
The constraint keeps the surface narrow: a workflow author can only route
to agents they already understand (because they already declared them as
space task node agents on nodes in this workflow) or the orchestrator. If
a post-approval step needs a different agent, add it as a node in the
workflow first.

### 1.6 Template grammar for `instructions`

Minimal, deterministic interpolation — no conditional logic, no expressions,
no code execution. The template string is split on `{{…}}` tokens and each
token is looked up against the interpolation context:

```ts
interface PostApprovalTemplateContext {
    /** From end-node structured-data: { pr_url: "..." }. */
    [key: string]: string | number | boolean | undefined;

    // Standard variables always provided by the runtime:
    autonomy_level: number;      // space.autonomyLevel at routing time (1–5)
    task_id: string;             // the task being closed
    task_title: string;          // task title
    reviewer_name: string;       // agent name of the end node that approved
    approval_source:             // how the task reached 'approved'
        'end_node' | 'human_review';
    space_id: string;
    workspace_path: string;
}
```

- Undefined variables render as the literal token (e.g. `{{pr_url}}` stays
  as `{{pr_url}}`) and emit a runtime warning. The target agent sees the
  gap and can ask the user for clarification via `request_human_input`.
- No escaping for `{`/`}` is needed in practice; the grammar is scoped to
  `{{identifier}}` where identifier is `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
- Templating is performed in a single pass in the Task Agent's routing
  code before the kickoff message is sent.

**Explicitly out of scope for v1:** conditionals (`{{#if}}`), iteration,
nested variable lookups, helper functions. The goal is a dumb string
substitute — anything more is delegated to the LLM reading the prompt.

---

## 2. End-node handoff protocol

*(Largely unchanged from the previous revision — the signalling mechanism
still fits the new design. Only §2.3 is rewritten to reflect the new
routing semantics.)*

### 2.1 Signalling mechanism — `send_message` to `task-agent` with structured `data`

The Task Agent already accepts `send_message({ target: 'task-agent', message, data })`
from node agents via the `taskAgentRouter` plumbed through
[`task-agent-manager.ts:2878-2882`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/task-agent-manager.ts)
and
[`agent-message-router.ts:237-238, 367-381`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/agent-message-router.ts).

When `data` is non-empty the router formats the delivered message as:

```
[Message from <fromAgentName>]: <message>

<structured-data>
{
  "pr_url": "...",
  "post_approval_action": "merge_pr"
}
</structured-data>
```

So the Task Agent can parse `pr_url` out of its conversation context with
zero new infrastructure.

**New convention:** end-node agents send, as a required step before calling
`approve_task()` / `submit_for_approval()`:

```ts
send_message({
    target: 'task-agent',
    message: 'Work complete. Post-approval data attached.',
    data: { pr_url: '<url>', post_approval_action: 'merge_pr' }
});
```

The `data` keys are **arbitrary** from the runtime's perspective — the Task
Agent uses them as the template interpolation context in §1.6. A workflow
whose `instructions` references `{{release_tag}}` would have its end node
signal `data: { release_tag: '...', post_approval_action: 'publish_release' }`
instead. The `post_approval_action` key is a **convention for the operator
reading the conversation**, not a runtime dispatch key — the runtime
dispatches on `workflow.postApproval.targetAgent`, not on the signalled
action.

### 2.2 Why not a gate write?

A gate on the `End → TaskAgent` channel could enforce that `pr_url` is
supplied. But:

- The Task Agent has **default bidirectional channels to all node agents**
  (task-agent-manager.ts and agent-message-router.ts) and those are not
  gate-enforced — gates live on workflow channels, not the implicit task-agent
  channel.
- Adding a gate solely for this would force every workflow author to learn a
  new gate pattern.
- The `data` payload delivered inline inside `<structured-data>…</structured-data>`
  is already the idiomatic way node agents pass typed info to the Task Agent
  (example: the Research node's research-ready-gate data is surfaced exactly
  this way).

If we decide later that stronger enforcement is needed (e.g. "end-node must
have signalled data matching its workflow's expected template variables
before its `approve_task` is accepted"), add a runtime check in Stage 3: on
`approve_task`, if the workflow has a `postApproval` referencing template
variables not present in any signalled `data`, log a warning and optionally
refuse.

### 2.3 When does the Task Agent act?

The Task Agent is **not** the routing driver — the runtime is (see §1.4).
The Task Agent observes two events for conversational awareness, but only
*acts* on one of them:

1. **Passive observation — structured data from the end node.** The
   `[Message from reviewer]: ...\n<structured-data>{...}</structured-data>`
   payload (§2.1) arrives in the Task Agent's conversation. No tool call
   required; it becomes part of context so the orchestrator can answer
   follow-up questions.
2. **Passive observation — `[TASK_APPROVED]`.** A runtime event injected
   when the task transitions to `approved`. Also informational: the Task
   Agent knows the work was approved and routing is now in flight.
3. **Active only when `targetAgent === 'task-agent'`.** In that specific
   case the runtime follows up the `[TASK_APPROVED]` event with a second
   injected user turn carrying the interpolated `instructions`. The Task
   Agent then performs the post-approval work using tools it already
   owns plus the new `mark_complete` tool, which it calls when done to
   transition the task from `approved → done` (see §3.2).

**Runtime injection shape (`[TASK_APPROVED]` — awareness only):**

```
[TASK_APPROVED] Task <taskId> ("<task-title>") was approved.

Post-approval routing:
  workflow: <workflow-name>
  target_agent: <target_agent or "none">
  approval_source: <end_node | human_review>
  session_status: <spawning | self | none>

No action required from you — this is informational. The runtime will
spawn the post-approval session (if target_agent is a space task node
agent) or deliver the instructions to you directly (if target_agent is
"task-agent") or close the task immediately (if no target).
```

**Runtime injection shape (post-approval instructions — only when
target_agent === "task-agent"):**

```
[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS] Task <taskId> post-approval work begins now.

<interpolated instructions from workflow.postApproval.instructions>

When you finish (or need to abort), call mark_complete to transition the
task from `approved` to `done`. If you need human input mid-work, call
request_human_input as usual.
```

One new MCP tool is added (`mark_complete`, §3.2). The routing decision
itself stays deterministic and lives in `PostApprovalRouter.route` in the
runtime layer (§1.4) — `mark_complete` only gates the final
`approved → done` transition, not the dispatch.

### 2.4 Prompt changes by node

*(Unchanged from the previous revision — all five built-in workflows still
need to emit the `send_message(task-agent, …)` step before `approve_task`.
The full list is identical to the previous §2.4.)*

All four built-in workflows' end-node prompts live in
[`built-in-workflows.ts`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/built-in-workflows.ts).
Exact edits:

#### 2.4.1 Coding Workflow — `CODING_WORKFLOW` Reviewer node
File: `built-in-workflows.ts:471-515`.
Replace the current step 5 ("If satisfied … `approve_task()` to close the task")
with:

```
5. If satisfied:
   a. Post an approval review: `gh pr review <pr-url> --approve --body-file <file>`
   b. Verify the PR is still open and mergeable.
   c. Signal the Task Agent that a merge is the post-approval action:
      send_message(
         target: "task-agent",
         message: "Reviewer approved. PR ready for post-approval.",
         data: { pr_url: "<url>", post_approval_action: "merge_pr" }
      )
   d. Call `save_artifact({ type: "result", append: true, summary, prUrl })` to record the audit entry.
   e. Call `approve_task()` to close the task. If autonomy blocks self-close,
      call `submit_for_approval({ reason: "…" })` instead — the Task Agent
      will still route post-approval once the human approves.
```

#### 2.4.2 Research Workflow — `RESEARCH_WORKFLOW` Review node
File: `built-in-workflows.ts:633-662`. Analogous change to step 6.

#### 2.4.3 Coding with QA Workflow — `FULLSTACK_QA_LOOP_WORKFLOW` QA node
File: `built-in-workflows.ts:1107-1135`.
**Remove** steps 5–6 ("merge the PR with `gh pr merge … --squash`" and "sync
worktree") entirely. QA no longer merges; a post-approval reviewer session
does. Replace with the same `send_message(task-agent, …)` + `approve_task`
sequence.

#### 2.4.4 Review-Only Workflow — `REVIEW_ONLY_WORKFLOW`
File: `built-in-workflows.ts:721-777`.
No merge to perform. No `postApproval` declared on the workflow. The
post-approval routing skips to `done` immediately. Prompt change:
remove the trailing paragraph about "the runtime verifies at least one
review/comment exists before accepting completion" — that ran via
`VERIFY_REVIEW_POSTED_COMPLETION_ACTION` which is being deleted.

Known regression (unchanged from previous revision): at Level 1 this is
still protected by human review; at Level ≥ 2 the lie slips through. See
§4.3 for mitigation options.

#### 2.4.5 Plan & Decompose Workflow — `PLAN_AND_DECOMPOSE_WORKFLOW`
File: `built-in-workflows.ts:952-972`.
No `postApproval` declared. Dispatcher prompt is unchanged.

## 3. Autonomy-level enforcement

### 3.1 Where the autonomy check lives (post-revision)

In the revised design, autonomy enforcement is **not a dedicated handler
check** (there is no dedicated handler). Instead, three layers hold the
line:

1. **Template-layer (guidance for the LLM):** the `postApproval.instructions`
   string for each workflow references `{{autonomy_level}}` and spells out
   the rule. A merge-PR instructions template, for example:
   > "Space autonomy level: {{autonomy_level}}. If autonomy >= 4, merge
   > directly. Otherwise, call `request_human_input` with a clear question
   > ('Approve merging PR {{pr_url}}?') before running any merge command.
   > Record the human's response as the merge justification."
2. **Tool-layer (authoritative — unchanged from today):** the
   post-approval session inherits the standard space autonomy enforcement
   applied to every tool call. Bash calls, file-write calls, and
   MCP-tool calls all run through the existing autonomy filter; a
   level-2 session cannot just `gh pr merge` if the space policy forbids
   destructive Bash at level 2. No new enforcement plumbing is needed.
3. **Session-kind-layer:** post-approval sessions can be given a narrower
   tool allowlist than the workflow-node session they correspond to, if
   we want to (e.g. `gh` + `git` + `cd` but no arbitrary `curl`). Scoping
   decision deferred to §7.2.

### 3.2 Task Agent system prompt addition + new `mark_complete` tool

**System prompt addition.** Amend
[`task-agent.ts:buildTaskAgentSystemPrompt`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/agents/task-agent.ts)
to add a short new `## Post-Approval` section after the existing
`## Human Gate Handling` section (~line 273):

```
## Post-Approval

When a task is approved (either via `approve_task()` from the end node, or
via human approval of a `submit_for_approval` request), the runtime
handles routing automatically. You receive a `[TASK_APPROVED]` event for
awareness; **no action from you is required** for that event.

The only case where you act is when the workflow's
`postApproval.targetAgent` is "task-agent". In that case the runtime
follows up with a `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` event carrying the
interpolated prompt. Perform the work using the tools already on this
MCP server (send_message, request_human_input, save_artifact,
list_artifacts). Do not attempt shell commands — you are an orchestrator,
not an executor.

When you finish the post-approval work, call `mark_complete` to
transition the task from `approved` to `done`. Note: `mark_complete` is
distinct from `approve_task`. `approve_task` means "the work is good"
(transitions `in_progress → approved`); `mark_complete` means
"post-approval is finished" (transitions `approved → done`). Never call
`approve_task` to close a task that's already `approved` — use
`mark_complete`.

If you need to abort post-approval (e.g. human rejection via
`request_human_input`), record the reason via `save_artifact` and still
call `mark_complete` — abandonment is a legitimate outcome of
post-approval, not a failure.
```

**New tool `mark_complete` in
[`task-agent-tools.ts`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/task-agent-tools.ts).**
Also mirrored onto the post-approval session's MCP surface so spawned
space task node agents can use the same tool.

| Caller's current task status | Effect of `mark_complete()` |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `approved` | Transitions `approved → done`. Clears `post_approval_session_id`. Emits observability log. |
| Any other status | Rejected with an explanatory error (e.g. "task is not in `approved` status; did you mean `approve_task`?"). |

Schema: `{ /* empty object — no args */ }`.

**`approve_task` tool behaviour — unchanged.** It still only accepts
`in_progress` and still transitions to `approved`. Rejecting it on an
`approved` task is the guardrail that forces callers to use the correct
signal for the correct transition.

### 3.3 `request_human_input` question scaffolding

When a target-agent session decides it needs human approval (the template
said `if autonomy < 4 → request_human_input first`), it calls the Task
Agent's existing `request_human_input` handler at
[`task-agent-tools.ts:759-801`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/task-agent-tools.ts).
This is the same path used by any workflow-node session that needs to pause
for a human — no changes here.

The template's guidance block steers the agent toward a consistent question
format (e.g. `"Approve merging PR {{pr_url}}?"`). Unlike the previous
revision, we do not snapshot-pin the exact string: the target agent's LLM
chooses the wording based on the instructions. If consistency is desired,
workflow authors can hardcode the question string inside the instructions
template:

```
If autonomy < 4, first call request_human_input with exactly
question="Approve merging PR {{pr_url}}?" and context="..." and wait for
the response before merging.
```

### 3.4 Idempotency / retry

Idempotency lives in two places:

1. **The target-agent session's own logic.** The session's LLM is told (via
   instructions) to check the current state before acting — e.g. "first run
   `gh pr view <url> --json state,mergedAt` — if the PR is already merged,
   record that and exit successfully."
2. **The underlying bash script used by merge templates.** The existing
   [`PR_MERGE_BASH_SCRIPT`](../../packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/built-in-workflows.ts)
   has a merged-state short-circuit. We keep the script body available as a
   reusable helper that merge-style `postApproval.instructions` can
   reference (e.g. "`bash /path/to/merge-helper.sh`"). Hoisting it to a
   standalone module (`packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/pr-merge-script.ts`)
   remains useful purely as a reusable helper for the built-in Coding
   workflow's instructions string; not as a runtime-executed primitive.

**Daemon restart mid-session.** The post-approval session is a regular
sub-session; the same restart-restore plumbing that covers workflow-node
sessions covers post-approval sessions. When the session restarts it re-reads
the PR state and decides: already done → exit success; not done → retry
from the top. The Task Agent's tracking (`post_approval_session_id` on the
task row) makes it easy to re-attach.

**Runtime re-routing / double-fire protection.** Since routing is a pure
function of `(task.status, workflow.postApproval)`, the `PostApprovalRouter`
guards against double-spawn by checking `post_approval_session_id` before
spawning: if one is already set and the referenced session is not in a
terminal state, routing returns a no-op. This covers the crash-and-restart
case — the router can be invoked safely on startup for any tasks still
sitting in `approved` with a session ID, and it will re-attach rather than
re-spawn.

### 3.5 Human-rejection path

If the target-agent session escalates (calls `submit_for_approval` on
itself, or the template's `request_human_input` response is a rejection):

1. The session records the rejection in an artifact.
2. The session calls `mark_complete` (rejection is a legitimate completion
   outcome for post-approval, not a failure — the work itself was already
   approved upstream). Task transitions `approved → done`.
3. If the session exits without calling `mark_complete` (crashed,
   timed out, etc.), the runtime falls back to observing session
   termination and transitions `approved → done` with an audit note.
4. An audit artifact on the task records "post-approval skipped:
   `human_rejected`".

If the session itself errors out irrecoverably (crashed, hit timeout, ran
out of retries):

1. Task stays in `approved`.
2. `postApprovalBlockedReason` is set.
3. A UI banner similar to today's PendingCompletionActionBanner shows
   "Post-approval failed: <reason>. [Retry | Mark done | View session]".
4. Operator can retry (re-spawn the same target agent with same
   instructions), manually advance, or inspect the session transcript.

This is a **minor design change from the previous revision.** Previously,
rejection always moved to `done`. In the revised design, *agent-initiated*
rejection (via the agent's own `submit_for_approval` or
`request_human_input(no)`) still moves to `done` (human decision), but
*session errors* stay in `approved` with a retry option (not a human
decision — a technical failure).

## 4. Completion-action removal

### 4.1 Code to delete outright

*(Unchanged from the previous revision; the old completion-action pipeline
is removed the same way regardless of what replaces it.)*

| Path | What to delete |
|------|----------------|
| `packages/shared/src/types/space.ts` | `CompletionAction` union, `ScriptCompletionAction`, `InstructionCompletionAction`, `McpCallCompletionAction`, `CompletionActionBase`, `McpCallExpectation` (lines 1481-1556). `WorkflowNode.completionActions` field (line 1032). `SpaceTask.pendingActionIndex`, `SpaceTask.pendingAction` (lines 280, 315-326). `'completion_action'` variant of `SpaceTask.pendingCheckpointType` (line 287). `SpaceWorkflowRun.completionActionsFiredAt` (line 641). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/space-runtime.ts` | `resolveCompletionWithActions` (lines 1881-2015). `resumeCompletionActions` (lines 932-1104). `executeCompletionAction` (lines 2067-2146). `resolveArtifactData` (lines 2153-2163). `buildAwaitingApprovalReason` (lines 71-76). `emitTaskAwaitingApproval` (lines 2028-2050). The two call sites at 613 and 1561 now call a new small helper `resolveTaskApproval(task, workflow)` that transitions to `approved` and emits `[TASK_APPROVED]`. |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/completion-action-executors.ts` | Entire file (285 lines). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/pending-action.ts` | Entire file (60 lines). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/space-runtime-service.ts` | `resumeCompletionActions` public API (lines 795-807). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/space-agent-tools.ts` | `approve_completion_action` handler (lines 944-1006) and its tool registration (line 1246). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/task-agent-tools.ts` | Add new tool `mark_complete` (takes no args; rejects unless task status is `approved`). Update `approve_task` description to clarify it only handles `in_progress → approved` — with a pointer to `mark_complete` for the other transition. `mark_complete` is also registered on the space-task-node-agent MCP surface (spawned post-approval sessions). |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/space-task-handlers.ts` | The `pendingCheckpointType === 'completion_action'` intercept in `spaceTask.update` (lines 154-203). `approvePendingCompletion` now transitions `review → approved` (not `review → done`) and invokes `PostApprovalRouter.route`. No new RPC. |
| `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/built-in-workflows.ts` | `MERGE_PR_COMPLETION_ACTION` (lines 187-194). `VERIFY_PR_MERGED_BASH_SCRIPT` + `VERIFY_PR_MERGED_COMPLETION_ACTION` (lines 204-239). `VERIFY_REVIEW_POSTED_BASH_SCRIPT` + `VERIFY_REVIEW_POSTED_COMPLETION_ACTION` (lines 246-282). `PLAN_AND_DECOMPOSE_VERIFY_SCRIPT` + `PLAN_AND_DECOMPOSE_VERIFY_COMPLETION_ACTION` (lines 792-830). Every `completionActions: [...]` entry on a node (lines 518, 664, 766, 972, 1135). **Add** `postApproval` on the 2 workflows that need it (Coding, Research, QA). `PR_MERGE_BASH_SCRIPT` stays but moves to `pr-merge-script.ts` (see §3.4). |
| `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingCompletionActionBanner.tsx` | Entire file (385 lines). |
| `packages/web/src/components/space/TaskStatusActions.tsx` | Remove import + render of `PendingCompletionActionBanner`. Replaced by the precedence-driven single-slot renderer introduced in §4.7. |
| `packages/web/src/components/space/SpaceTaskPane.tsx` | Remove the 3-conditional banner stack (lines 421-446). Render exactly one banner selected by `resolveActiveTaskBanner(task, run, gates)` (§4.7). |
| `packages/web/src/components/space/InlineStatusBanner.tsx` | **NEW** — shared single-line banner primitive (§4.7.4). |
| `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingPostApprovalBanner.tsx` | **NEW** — surfaces a task stuck in `approved` after post-approval failed/escalated (§3.5). Ships in PR 2 as a one-liner from day one. |
| `packages/web/src/lib/task-banner.ts` | **NEW** — `resolveActiveTaskBanner` precedence helper (§4.7.2). |
| `packages/shared/src/space/workflow-autonomy.ts` | `EMPTY_ACTIONS_AUTONOMY_THRESHOLD`, `isAutonomousWithoutActions`, `BlockingAction`, `BlockingWorkflow`, `AutonomousWorkflowCount`, `isWorkflowAutonomousAtLevel`, `countAutonomousWorkflows`, `collectCompletionActions` — replace with a single `isWorkflowAutoClosingAtLevel(wf, level)` that checks only `level >= (wf.completionAutonomyLevel ?? 5)`. |

### 4.2 Code to keep / repurpose

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| `completionAutonomyLevel` on `SpaceWorkflow` | **Keep.** It still controls whether the end-node agent's `approve_task` is unlocked vs. forced onto `submit_for_approval` — orthogonal to the post-approval step. |
| `submit_for_approval` + `approvePendingCompletion` RPC + `PendingTaskCompletionBanner` | **Keep.** This is the human-approves-the-work path; the transition target changes from `review → done` to `review → approved` but the user-visible UX is unchanged. |
| `pendingCheckpointType = 'task_completion'` variant | **Keep.** Still used by `submit_for_approval`. |
| `pendingCompletionSubmittedByNodeId`, `pendingCompletionSubmittedAt`, `pendingCompletionReason` | **Keep.** |
| `space_task_report_results` table (migration 99) | **Keep.** Audit table; orphaned writers can be dropped in a later cleanup. |
| `PR_MERGE_BASH_SCRIPT` string body | **Move and keep.** Hoist to `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/pr-merge-script.ts` as a reusable helper. The built-in Coding workflow's `postApproval.instructions` string can reference this path directly; user workflows can ignore it. |

### 4.3 Lost functionality & mitigations

*(Unchanged from the previous revision — removing the completion-action
pipeline has the same cost either way.)*

| Lost check | Provided by | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `verify-pr-merged` (QA-loop) | double-check that QA agent actually merged | No longer needed — post-approval reviewer session is the merger, not the QA agent. |
| `verify-review-posted` (Review-Only) | catches reviewer lying about posting review | Rely on the agent's contract; operator can inspect the PR. Optional follow-up: require a saved `reviewUrl` artifact before allowing `approve_task`. |
| `verify-tasks-created` (Plan-and-Decompose) | catches dispatcher lying about creating tasks | Same pattern — optional follow-up tool if the regression proves painful. |
| `'blocked'` status on post-hoc verification failure | escalated silently to a blocked task | Task Agent's `submit_for_approval` path produces the same end state via a different trigger. |
| `Awaiting Human Approval` banner (`PendingCompletionActionBanner`) | per-action modal UI | `request_human_input` → `TaskBlockedBanner` + plain conversation input now covers this. Operators answer the Task Agent's (or post-approval session's) question in free text. |

### 4.4 DB migration

New migration (number = next after current tip):

```sql
-- Stage 1 migration (adds 'approved' status + post_approval_session_id column).
-- Step 1: extend space_tasks.status CHECK constraint to include 'approved'.
-- SQLite requires table-rebuild pattern (see migration 99 for template).
-- New allowed values: open, in_progress, review, approved, done, blocked,
-- cancelled, archived.

-- Step 2: add post_approval_session_id TEXT NULL column.
-- Step 3: add post_approval_started_at INTEGER NULL column.
-- Step 4: add post_approval_blocked_reason TEXT NULL column.

-- Stage 5 migration (removes completion-action columns).
-- Step 5: rewrite any live tasks paused at 'completion_action'.
-- At Stage 5 time, Stages 3 + 4 will have rewritten runtime paths to never
-- produce this value. Defensively rewrite:
UPDATE space_tasks
SET pending_checkpoint_type = 'task_completion',
    pending_action_index = NULL
WHERE pending_checkpoint_type = 'completion_action';

-- Step 6: drop pending_action_index column.
-- Step 7: tighten CHECK constraint on pending_checkpoint_type:
--   from: CHECK (pending_checkpoint_type IN ('completion_action', 'gate', 'task_completion'))
--   to:   CHECK (pending_checkpoint_type IN ('gate', 'task_completion'))
-- Step 8: drop completion_actions_fired_at from space_workflow_runs.
-- Step 9: (optional) drop space_task_report_results if audit confirms no
-- writer remains. Defer to a later cleanup migration.
```

`completionAutonomyLevel` stays — no data migration needed for it.

### 4.5 Tests to delete / update

*(Updated from the previous revision to reflect the new test additions.)*

- Delete outright:
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/runtime/space-runtime-completion-actions.test.ts`
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/workflow/completion-actions-persistence.test.ts`
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/runtime/completion-action-executors.test.ts`
  - `packages/web/src/components/space/__tests__/PendingCompletionActionBanner.test.tsx`
  - `packages/e2e/tests/features/space-completion-action-approval.e2e.ts`
- Update (remove `approve_completion_action` / completion-action cases):
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/runtime/space-agent-tools.test.ts`
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/agent/end-node-handlers.test.ts`
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/workflow/built-in-workflows.test.ts`
  - `packages/daemon/tests/unit/2-handlers/rpc-handlers/space-task-handlers.test.ts`
  - `packages/shared/tests/workflow-autonomy.test.ts`
  - `packages/web/src/lib/__tests__/space-store.test.ts`
- Update (reflect new workflow prompts + `postApproval` entries):
  - Any test that asserts specific prompt text from the five built-in workflows.

### 4.6 New tests to add

Under `packages/daemon/tests/unit/5-space/`:

- `workflow/post-approval-validator.test.ts`
  - `targetAgent` = declared space task node agent → valid.
  - `targetAgent` = `task-agent` → valid.
  - `targetAgent` = unknown → invalid + error lists eligible targets.
  - Missing `postApproval` → valid (optional).
- `workflow/post-approval-template.test.ts`
  - Happy-path interpolation with all keys provided.
  - Missing key renders as `{{key}}` literal + warning.
  - Interpolation is a single pass (no recursive expansion).
  - Special characters in values are passed through unchanged (no HTML
    escaping, no shell escaping — the downstream agent handles that).
- `runtime/post-approval-router.test.ts`
  - `approved` task with no `postApproval` → router transitions directly
    to `done`; no session spawned; no tool-call required.
  - `approved` task with space-task-node-agent target → router spawns a
    new sub-session with the interpolated kickoff and records
    `post_approval_session_id` + `post_approval_started_at`.
  - `approved` task with `target_agent: 'task-agent'` → router injects a
    `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` turn into the existing Task Agent
    session; no new session spawn; no `post_approval_session_id`.
  - `[TASK_APPROVED]` is emitted with the correct payload shape on both
    `approve_task` and `approvePendingCompletion` paths.
  - Double-fire protection: invoking `route` twice on the same
    already-routed task is a no-op (returns existing session ID).
- `runtime/task-status-transitions.test.ts`
  - `in_progress → approved` via `approve_task` (end node).
  - `review → approved` via `approvePendingCompletion` (human).
  - `approved → done` via `mark_complete` (post-approval agent — spawned
    node agent OR Task Agent for `'task-agent'` target).
  - `approved → done` via runtime fallback on session termination
    without `mark_complete`.
  - `approved → blocked` disallowed in Stage 2 (deferred to §7).
- `agent/task-agent-mark-complete.test.ts`
  - `mark_complete` called on a task in `approved` status transitions to
    `done` and clears `post_approval_session_id`.
  - `mark_complete` called on a task in any other status is rejected with
    an explanatory error that points callers at `approve_task`.
  - `approve_task` called on a task already in `approved` status is
    rejected (the guardrail preventing accidental overload).
- `workflows/end-node-handoff.test.ts`
  - For each of the 5 built-in workflows, snapshot-test the end-node's
    customPrompt to ensure the post-approval signalling instructions are
    present (and the old `gh pr merge` / completion-action references are
    absent).

E2E test additions (`packages/e2e/tests/features/`):

- `post-approval-merge-autonomy-high.e2e.ts` — Level 4 space, run the Coding
  workflow against a fake PR; assert the task reaches `approved`, the
  post-approval reviewer session spawns, merges, and the task reaches
  `done` without human interaction.
- `post-approval-merge-autonomy-low.e2e.ts` — Level 1 space, run the Coding
  workflow; assert the post-approval session pauses at
  `human_input_requested`; simulate the human approving via the
  conversation input; assert merge happens afterward.
- `post-approval-merge-human-rejects.e2e.ts` — Level 1 space, human rejects
  via `request_human_input`; assert PR is not merged, task reaches `done`,
  audit artifact records the rejection.
- `post-approval-no-route.e2e.ts` — Research workflow with no `postApproval`
  declared; assert task goes straight from `approved → done`.

These E2E tests need a mock `gh` CLI. Reuse existing E2E PR-fixture
infrastructure if present; otherwise add `tests/e2e/helpers/mock-gh.sh`
injected on the PATH.

### 4.7 UI consolidation — one banner slot, one-line rule

The current `SpaceTaskPane` renders approval/warning banners as three
independent conditionals (see `SpaceTaskPane.tsx:421-446`):

```tsx
{task.status === 'blocked' ? <TaskBlockedBanner /> : (
  <>
    {task.pendingCheckpointType === 'completion_action' && <PendingCompletionActionBanner />}
    {task.pendingCheckpointType === 'task_completion'  && <PendingTaskCompletionBanner />}
    {task.workflowRunId                                && <PendingGateBanner />}
  </>
)}
```

This allows two banners to stack (e.g. `PendingGateBanner` next to
`PendingTaskCompletionBanner`) — **but those states cannot actually coexist
on the same task**. A gate blocks the workflow run; the end node only runs
once all gates have cleared; only then can `submit_for_approval` fire. So
the two banners are mutually exclusive in time, and the independent-render
code is defensive noise.

This section collapses the approval surface to a single slot and enforces a
one-line rule across all banners. Anything longer opens a modal.

#### 4.7.1 Principles

1. **One active banner per task.** At most one of the
   {gate-approval, task-approval, post-approval-blocked, task-blocked}
   banners renders at any time.
2. **One line of text, max.** Each banner surfaces: an icon, a short label
   (≤ ~60 chars), optionally an elapsed-time badge, and one or two action
   buttons. Nothing else inline.
3. **More info → modal.** Agent rationale, gate artifact data, diff
   preview, feedback text area, script source, stack traces — all of these
   open via a "Details" (or "Review") button into a modal.
4. **Shared primitive.** A single `<InlineStatusBanner>` component
   enforces consistent geometry (icon slot, label slot, CTA slot). All
   specific banners compose it.

#### 4.7.2 Banner precedence

New helper in `packages/web/src/lib/task-banner.ts`:

```ts
type ActiveBanner =
  | { kind: 'blocked'; reason: TaskBlockReason }
  | { kind: 'post_approval_blocked'; reason: string }
  | { kind: 'gate_pending'; runId: string }
  | { kind: 'task_completion_pending' }
  | null;

function resolveActiveTaskBanner(
    task: SpaceTask,
    run: SpaceWorkflowRun | undefined,
    gates: ReadonlyArray<GateState> | undefined
): ActiveBanner;
```

Precedence order (first match wins):

1. `task.status === 'blocked'` → `blocked` (includes `gate_rejected`,
   `execution_failed`, etc. — unchanged variant set; `TaskBlockedBanner`
   already handles these)
2. `task.status === 'approved' && task.postApprovalBlockedReason` →
   `post_approval_blocked` *(new)*
3. `task.pendingCheckpointType === 'task_completion'` →
   `task_completion_pending`
4. `task.workflowRunId` AND any gate in that run is `waiting_human` →
   `gate_pending`
5. Otherwise → `null` (no banner)

`SpaceTaskPane.tsx` renders exactly **one** banner selected by this helper.
The per-checkpoint conditionals are deleted.

`PendingCompletionActionBanner` is removed entirely in PR 4 (§4.1) and is
absent from the precedence list.

#### 4.7.3 Per-banner redesign

Each banner is trimmed to the one-line rule. Details move into an
existing-or-new modal.

| Banner | Before | After (inline) | Modal content |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| `PendingGateBanner` | Medium panel; one row per gate; description line + 3 buttons; optional error line | *One* row per gate: icon + gate label + "Awaiting approval" + `[Approve]` `[Reject]` `[Review]` buttons. No description line, no error line inline (truncate + tooltip). If run has multiple waiting gates, render a single consolidated line: "3 gates awaiting approval" + `[Review]` which opens the existing `GateArtifactsView` listing them. | `GateArtifactsView` (existing) — gate data, artifacts, decision controls. Also absorbs the error message that currently renders inline. |
| `PendingTaskCompletionBanner` | Short banner (already ~1 line) + 2 modals | Inline: icon + "Awaiting approval" + elapsed-time badge + `[Approve]` `[Send back]` `[Details]`. Keep the existing Approve/Reject modals; add a `[Details]` that opens a modal showing agent outcome + rationale (currently inline in the Approve modal — hoist to its own Details modal). | Unchanged Approve / Reject modals; new Details modal. |
| `PendingCompletionActionBanner` | Inline + modals | **Deleted** in PR 4. | — |
| `PendingPostApprovalBanner` *(new, PR 2)* | n/a | Icon + "Post-approval blocked: `<short-reason>`" + `[Retry]` `[Mark done]` `[View session]`. No inline transcript or stack. | `[View session]` navigates to the session UI (not a modal). `[Mark done]` confirms in a small modal. `[Retry]` re-spawns the target agent; shows a toast on success. |
| `TaskBlockedBanner` | Multi-variant: 2–3 lines per variant, different inline content per `blockReason` | One line per variant: icon + short label (e.g. "Blocked: agent crashed", "Blocked: dependency failed") + primary CTA (`[Resume]` / `[Review]` / `[Details]`). Long error messages move into a Details modal. `human_input_requested` stays as the current one-line hint ("Reply via composer") with no CTA — already minimal. | Details modal shows full reason, error message, and any linked run context. |

For the `gate_rejected` variant of `TaskBlockedBanner`, the Details modal
is `GateArtifactsView` (same as `PendingGateBanner`'s Review) so the user
has one mental model for "inspect a gate".

#### 4.7.4 Shared primitive

New component `packages/web/src/components/space/InlineStatusBanner.tsx`:

```tsx
interface InlineStatusBannerProps {
    icon: ComponentChildren;          // status icon (Pause, Lock, Alert, Clock…)
    tone: 'info' | 'warn' | 'danger'; // color family
    label: string;                    // ≤ 60 chars, single line, truncated with ellipsis
    meta?: string;                    // optional right-aligned badge (e.g. elapsed time)
    actions?: BannerAction[];         // ordered left-to-right; at most 3
}
interface BannerAction {
    label: string;      // ≤ 14 chars
    onClick: () => void;
    variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}
```

Fixed height, single-line truncation, consistent tone classes. All specific
banners (`PendingGateBanner`, `PendingTaskCompletionBanner`,
`PendingPostApprovalBanner`, `TaskBlockedBanner`) compose this primitive
and own only their own modals.

#### 4.7.5 Modal conventions

- Modals are rendered outside the banner tree (portal) so the banner row
  stays compact and predictable.
- Modals share the existing `Modal` primitive; no new modal shell.
- Modals may be long-form (full-screen overlay for gate artifacts, medium
  dialog for approve/reject confirmations) — that's fine, the rule is
  about *inline* noise, not modal content.
- Every banner's `[Details]` / `[Review]` button is keyboard-accessible
  and has a consistent aria-label pattern: `"Show details for <label>"`.

#### 4.7.6 Tests to update / add

- `packages/web/src/lib/__tests__/task-banner.test.ts` (new) — precedence
  resolver: blocked > post_approval_blocked > task_completion_pending >
  gate_pending > null. Exhaustive status+checkpoint+gate combinations.
- `packages/web/src/components/space/__tests__/InlineStatusBanner.test.tsx`
  (new) — snapshot: 1 line height regardless of label length; truncation
  at ~60 chars; 3 actions max.
- Update existing banner tests to assert:
  - No inline text longer than one line.
  - Details/Review actions open modals; rationale/feedback text lives only
    in modals, not inline.
- Delete `PendingCompletionActionBanner.test.tsx` (component removed).
- Add E2E: `post-approval-banner-minimal.e2e.ts` — for each approval
  state, assert the banner container has a computed height equal to a
  single-line banner (regression guard against future bloat).

#### 4.7.7 Scope and staging

This consolidation lands in **PR 4** (the completion-action pipeline
removal PR) because:

- PR 4 already deletes `PendingCompletionActionBanner` and touches
  `SpaceTaskPane.tsx` / `TaskStatusActions.tsx`.
- Collapsing the three independent conditionals into a single precedence
  slot is a natural simplification once the `completion_action` branch is
  gone.
- Adds ~400 LOC (new primitive + precedence helper + modal extractions)
  and removes ~200 LOC (inline rationale/error sections), net additional
  change is modest.

The new `PendingPostApprovalBanner` ships in **PR 2** as a one-liner from
day one (no pre-refactor stage), so it sets the precedent for the PR 4
consolidation.

## 5. Workflow definition changes — summary table

| Workflow | `completionActions` removed | `completionAutonomyLevel` | `postApproval` added | Prompt change |
|---------|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| CODING_WORKFLOW | `[MERGE_PR_COMPLETION_ACTION]` | keep at 3 | `{ targetAgent: 'reviewer', instructions: <merge template> }` | Reviewer step 5 — add `send_message(task-agent)` before `approve_task` |
| RESEARCH_WORKFLOW | `[MERGE_PR_COMPLETION_ACTION]` | keep at 2 | `{ targetAgent: 'reviewer', instructions: <merge template> }` | Review step 6 — add `send_message(task-agent)` before `approve_task` |
| FULLSTACK_QA_LOOP_WORKFLOW | `[VERIFY_PR_MERGED_COMPLETION_ACTION]` | **lower from 4 to 3** | `{ targetAgent: 'reviewer', instructions: <merge template> }` | QA steps 5–6 — remove `gh pr merge` + worktree sync; replace with `send_message(task-agent)` |
| REVIEW_ONLY_WORKFLOW | `[VERIFY_REVIEW_POSTED_COMPLETION_ACTION]` | keep at 2 | (none — no post-approval work) | Review step 6 — trim verification boilerplate |
| PLAN_AND_DECOMPOSE_WORKFLOW | `[PLAN_AND_DECOMPOSE_VERIFY_COMPLETION_ACTION]` | keep at 3 | (none — no post-approval work) | Dispatcher — no change |

**Merge-template `instructions` string (shared across Coding, Research, QA):**

```
The task has been approved. Your job is to merge PR {{pr_url}}.

Space autonomy level: {{autonomy_level}} (threshold for auto-merge: 4).
Reviewer: {{reviewer_name}}.
Approval source: {{approval_source}}.

Steps:
1. Verify the PR is still open and passes CI:
     gh pr view {{pr_url}} --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
   If state is MERGED, record an audit artifact and exit — the work is done.
2. If autonomy_level < 4:
     Call request_human_input with
       question: "Approve merging PR {{pr_url}}?"
       context: "Reviewer: {{reviewer_name}}. CI: <from step 1>."
     Wait for the response before proceeding.
3. Merge:
     gh pr merge {{pr_url}} --squash --delete-branch
   On a merge conflict, do NOT force — exit, call request_human_input with
   a clear summary of the conflict, and let the human resolve.
4. Sync your worktree with main/dev:
     git fetch origin && git checkout dev && git pull --ff-only
5. Save an audit artifact:
     save_artifact({ type: "result", append: true,
                     data: { merged_pr_url, mergedAt, approval: "auto"|"human" } })
6. Call mark_complete() to signal post-approval finished
   (transitions the task from `approved` to `done`).
   DO NOT call approve_task — that's for the initial "work is good"
   transition (in_progress → approved), which already happened upstream.
```

The QA-workflow `completionAutonomyLevel` drop from 4 → 3 is a behavioural
intent change worth calling out in the PR description: today,
Coding-with-QA requires Level 4 to self-close because the QA agent is the
merger. After this change, the QA agent no longer merges, so Level 3 is the
natural threshold (aligned with Coding). Auto-merge remains a separate
autonomy dimension, now enforced by the template's conditional at the
post-approval session layer rather than at the `merge_pr` tool layer.

## 6. Migration & rollout

### 6.1 Breaking change assessment

- **Workflow schema (shared types):** removing `completionActions`,
  `CompletionAction`, `completionActionsFiredAt`, `pendingActionIndex`,
  `pendingCheckpointType: 'completion_action'` is a breaking change to
  `@neokai/shared`. NeoKai ships as a single repo; no external consumers.
  Adding `postApproval` is an additive, non-breaking change.
- **Task status `approved`:** additive; existing status values unchanged.
  No existing caller queries for `approved` tasks (it didn't exist). UI
  lists and filters need to be taught about it (Stage 1).
- **Built-in workflows (DB rows):** the `seedBuiltInWorkflows` seeder
  re-stamps template rows via `computeWorkflowHash`. Seeder must rebuild
  built-in rows in Stage 3 to pick up the new `postApproval` fields.
- **In-flight runs at migration time:** a daemon upgrade mid-run where the
  task is paused at `pendingCheckpointType='completion_action'`. Stage 5
  migration rewrites these to `task_completion` so the task surfaces in the
  submit-for-approval banner; the operator can click through.
- **User workflows that declare `completionActions`:** the workflow
  validator must learn to strip unknown fields with a warning so users
  don't hit a hard error on load. Emit a `workflow.migrated` notification
  in that case. (Same as the previous revision.)

### 6.2 Suggested PR breakdown (5 PRs)

- **PR 1** — **Task state `approved` + workflow schema.**
  Adds `TaskStatus='approved'`, `WorkflowDefinition.postApproval` type,
  validator, template interpolator, `post_approval_session_id` column +
  migration. No behaviour change (nothing reads `approved` in this PR).
  Unit-tested. ~600 LOC; self-contained.
- **PR 2** — **Runtime-driven post-approval routing.**
  New `PostApprovalRouter` module in the runtime layer performs the
  deterministic dispatch: no-target → direct `approved → done`;
  task-agent target → inject `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` turn;
  space-task-node-agent target → spawn sub-session. New `mark_complete`
  MCP tool (Task Agent + spawned post-approval sessions) gates the
  `approved → done` transition; `approve_task` stays scoped to
  `in_progress → approved`. Runtime emits `[TASK_APPROVED]` as an
  awareness-only event. Task Agent system prompt gets a short
  `## Post-Approval` section. Behind a feature flag
  (`NEOKAI_TASK_AGENT_POST_APPROVAL_ROUTING`). ~750 LOC; depends on PR 1.
- **PR 3** — **End-node handoff + built-in workflow `postApproval`
  entries.** Update all 5 built-in workflow prompts. Populate `postApproval`
  on Coding, Research, QA. Flip the feature flag. ~500 LOC; depends on PR 2.
- **PR 4** — **Delete completion-action runtime pipeline + UI
  consolidation.** Remove `resolveCompletionWithActions`,
  `resumeCompletionActions`, `executeCompletionAction`, the RPC intercept,
  `approve_completion_action` MCP tool, `PendingCompletionActionBanner`.
  Task/run completion flows through the new `approved → done` path. Also
  collapses the approval banner stack into a single-slot precedence
  (`resolveActiveTaskBanner`) and trims every remaining banner to a
  one-line inline + modal-for-details pattern (see §4.7). ~1500 LOC
  net-negative after the UI refactor nets out (~400 added / ~200 removed
  for the banner work). Depends on PR 3 being deployed long enough to
  confirm the new path works.
- **PR 5** — **Schema / shared-types / DB migration + docs.** Drop
  `pending_action_index`, `pending_checkpoint_type='completion_action'`,
  `completion_actions_fired_at`, `MERGE_PR_COMPLETION_ACTION` etc. Docs
  refresh, changelog entry. ~700 LOC. Depends on PR 4.

### 6.3 Test strategy summary

| Layer | Scope | Files |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Unit — daemon | Validator, template interpolator, routing, state transitions, spawning, end-node handoff, workflow snapshots | §4.6 list |
| Unit — shared | `TaskStatus` enum tests, workflow-autonomy helper simplification | `packages/shared/tests/workflow-autonomy.test.ts` (rewrite) |
| Integration — daemon online tests | Simulate full Coding/Research/QA runs with dev-proxy; assert `approved → done` works at each autonomy level | `packages/daemon/tests/online/space/` (new files) |
| E2E | End-to-end from UI input through post-approval session, with mock `gh` | §4.6 list |
| Manual | Spin up a dev space at each autonomy level 1–5; kick a Coding workflow against a real GitHub PR; observe behaviour | Pre-merge of PR 3 + 4 |

### 6.4 Observability / rollback

- Add structured daemon log entries:
  - `post-approval.route: spaceId=... taskId=... targetAgent=... mode=<spawn|inline|none> autonomyLevel=...`
  - `post-approval.complete: spaceId=... taskId=... outcome=done|blocked reason=... mode=<spawn|inline>`
  - `task.status-transition: taskId=... from=... to=... source=<approve_task|approvePendingCompletion|post-approval-router|...>`
- Feature flag (`NEOKAI_TASK_AGENT_POST_APPROVAL_ROUTING`) allows a quick
  disable. When disabled, tasks transition directly to `done` and no
  post-approval session spawns — identical to today's no-completion-actions
  behaviour for workflows without `postApproval`.
- PRs 4 and 5 are effectively one-way doors once merged. If a regression is
  found after they ship, the fix is forward-only.

## 7. Open questions / decisions for review

1. **Session kind for post-approval.** **Decided: A.** Reuse the existing
   `space_task_agent` sub-session kind; add a field `isPostApproval: true`
   to distinguish from a regular node execution. Fewer moving parts,
   integrates with existing `[NODE_COMPLETE]` event plumbing. Revisit in
   Stage 5 if the flag becomes load-bearing for queries.

2. **Tool-allowlist scoping for post-approval sessions.**
   Can we narrow the tool surface (e.g. drop `curl`, drop file-write
   outside the worktree)? The target agent's default surface may be broader
   than the post-approval step needs.
   **Recommendation:** **No restriction in v1.** Keeping the surface
   identical to the node-session makes the template instructions
   transferable. Narrowing is a follow-up hardening pass if operators find
   a specific abuse pattern.

3. **Task stuck in `approved` with failed post-approval session — UX.**
   The `PendingPostApprovalBanner` surfaces a stuck task. What actions
   should it offer?
   - Retry (re-spawn same target agent with same instructions).
   - Mark done manually (record an audit artifact, advance to `done`).
   - View session transcript (routes to the session UI).
   - Escalate (convert to `blocked` with a reason).
   **Recommendation:** include all four in v1; escalation is the
   out-of-band option when retry doesn't work.

4. **Template interpolation: escape hatches.**
   Should `{{` be escapable? Should the grammar support literal `{{…}}`
   in output? Relevant when an `instructions` string wants to embed example
   template syntax for the LLM to learn from.
   **Recommendation:** no escaping in v1. If a template ever needs to
   output a literal `{{foo}}`, the author can use `{ {foo}}` as an escape
   hatch.

5. **Post-approval on multi-task missions.**
   Missions (workflow runs spanning several tasks) reach `done` when their
   last task reaches `done`. Does post-approval run per-task or once per
   mission? The current design is **per-task** (each task has its own
   `approved → done` with its own post-approval). A mission-level
   `postApproval` could be added later as a separate `MissionDefinition`
   field; not in scope here.

6. **Review-Only and Plan-and-Decompose verification regressions.**
   Do we accept losing the verify-review-posted / verify-tasks-created
   checks, or reintroduce them as optional post-approval templates (e.g.
   `targetAgent: 'task-agent'` + instructions "before closing, verify the
   reviewer posted an actual review")?
   **Recommendation:** accept the regression for Stage 4; revisit as a
   follow-up if operator feedback indicates the checks were load-bearing.

7. **Completion signal for post-approval work.** ✅ Decided: a new
   dedicated tool `mark_complete` (§3.2). Same tool is used by both
   spawned space task node agents and the Task Agent (in the
   `'task-agent'` target case). Alternatives considered and rejected:
   - *Infer completion from turn-end (no pending tool calls).* Ambiguous —
     a `request_human_input` pause looks the same as end-of-work.
   - *Overload `approve_task`* (make it idempotent for `approved → done`).
     Rejected by reviewer/user feedback: the same tool name would mean
     two different things depending on caller status (work-approval vs.
     post-approval-done), which is a surprising footgun for both humans
     reading the prompts and LLMs picking the right call.
   An explicit separately-named tool is unambiguous: `approve_task` =
   "work is good" (`in_progress → approved`); `mark_complete` =
   "post-approval finished" (`approved → done`).

---

## 8. Revision history

**2026-04-23 revision 4 (this revision):** UI consolidation pass triggered
by direct user feedback on the current banner surface:

1. **Single-slot approval banner.** The current `SpaceTaskPane` renders
   `PendingGateBanner`, `PendingTaskCompletionBanner`, and
   `PendingCompletionActionBanner` as three independent conditionals that
   are allowed to stack. But per-task those states cannot coexist in time
   (a gate blocks the run, so the end node never reaches
   `submit_for_approval` until gates clear). Collapse to a single
   precedence-driven slot (`resolveActiveTaskBanner`) that renders at most
   one banner at a time.
2. **One-line rule for all banners.** Each banner surfaces only a short
   label + one or two action buttons inline. Agent rationale, gate
   artifacts, error traces, and feedback fields move behind
   `[Details]` / `[Review]` buttons into modals. A new shared primitive
   `<InlineStatusBanner>` enforces consistent geometry.
3. Covers all existing + planned banners: `PendingGateBanner`,
   `PendingTaskCompletionBanner`, `PendingPostApprovalBanner` (new, ships
   as a one-liner from PR 2), `TaskBlockedBanner` (all variants).
   `PendingCompletionActionBanner` is still deleted in PR 4 as planned.

New section: **§4.7 UI consolidation**. Also touches §4.1 (delete-table
adds three NEW-file rows for the primitive, the new banner, and the
precedence helper), §6.2 PR 4 scope (adds UI refactor), Appendix B (two
new decision rows).

**2026-04-23 revision 3:** Two follow-up refinements after
more direct user feedback:

1. **Drop the `approve_task` overload; introduce `mark_complete`.**
   Rev 2 made `approve_task` idempotent so calling it on an already-
   `approved` task would flip `approved → done`. User pushed back: same
   tool name with two meanings is confusing. Introduce a new dedicated
   tool `mark_complete` (no args, status-restricted to `approved`) used
   by spawned space task node agents and by the Task Agent (for the
   `'task-agent'` target case) to signal post-approval completion.
   `approve_task` stays scoped to `in_progress → approved`.
2. **Terminology: "space task node agent" replaces "workflow-agent
   role".** Consistent label for agent sessions spawned per workflow
   node. The term is not yet used in the codebase; the new
   `post-approval-router.ts` module will introduce it in a doc comment
   cross-referencing the existing `'node_agent'` kind in
   `packages/shared/src/types/space.ts`.

Key sections touched: §0 items 4+6 (new tool, new term), §1.4, §2.3
(POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS shape), §3.2 (rewritten around
`mark_complete`), §3.5 (human-rejection signals via `mark_complete`),
§4.1 (new tool registered), §4.6 (test renamed to
`task-agent-mark-complete.test.ts`), §5 (merge template step 6 updated
with explicit DO-NOT-call-approve_task note), §6.2 PR 2, §7.7 (decision
locked in), §8, Appendix A, Appendix B (new row).

**2026-04-23 revision 2:** Dropped the proposed
`spawn_post_approval_session` + `completePostApproval` MCP tools on the
Task Agent server after direct user feedback: routing is deterministic
(a pure function of `workflow.postApproval`), so putting it behind an LLM
tool-call gate is wrong. Routing moved to a new runtime module
(`PostApprovalRouter`). Task Agent's only new responsibility: receive
`[TASK_APPROVED]` for awareness; when `targetAgent === 'task-agent'`,
also act on an injected `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` turn. Completion
was signalled via idempotent `approve_task` — subsequently revised to
`mark_complete` (see rev 3 above).

- §1.4: renamed "Task Agent routing mechanics" → "Runtime-driven routing
  mechanics"; routing happens in `PostApprovalRouter.route`, not via Task
  Agent tool calls.
- §2.3: reframed as "Task Agent observes (2 events), acts in 1 case".
  Added `[POST_APPROVAL_INSTRUCTIONS]` event shape.
- §3.4 / §3.5: retired Task Agent re-routing framing; completion and
  double-fire protection live in the runtime router.
- §4.1 table: removed the "add new tools" row for the two rev-1 tools.
- Appendix B: added row for "Routing trigger: Task Agent LLM vs. runtime".

**2026-04-23 revision 1:** Approach changed from "narrow `merge_pr` MCP
tool on Task Agent" to "workflow-declared post-approval agent routing",
based on review feedback that the MCP-tool approach was too rigid for
real-world post-approval work.

- §0, §1: rewritten around workflow schema `postApproval` field, new task
  status `approved`, agent-spawn routing model. §1.2 replaced ("Why a
  post-approval agent, not a dedicated MCP tool").
- §2.3: reframed `[TASK_APPROVED]` event as a routing signal.
- §3.1: autonomy enforcement moves from handler-layer to template-layer +
  tool-layer.
- §5: workflows now declare `postApproval` instead of `completionActions`;
  added the shared merge-template `instructions` string.
- §6.2: five-PR breakdown reorganised around the new stages.
- §7: open questions rewritten for the new design.

Original revision (PR #1611) preserved in git history on branch
`space/task-agent-merge-pr-mcp-tool-handler-script-module-behind`.
Reusable carry-overs: `PR_MERGE_BASH_SCRIPT` hoist to
`pr-merge-script.ts`, end-node signalling via `send_message(task-agent,
data)`, unchanged sections §2 (signal protocol concepts), §4.1–4.3
(completion-action removal scope), §6.1 (breaking-change assessment).

## Appendix A — File path cheat sheet

Key files referenced in this plan, grouped by area:

**Task Agent wiring**
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/agents/task-agent.ts` — system prompt + session init (add short §3.2 `## Post-Approval` section)
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/task-agent-manager.ts` — session lifecycle, sub-session events, post-approval session spawn plumbing (consumed by `PostApprovalRouter`)
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/task-agent-tools.ts` — add new `mark_complete` tool (no-arg; accepts only `approved` status); `approve_task` description clarified to scope it to `in_progress → approved` (does not accept `approved`)
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/task-agent-tool-schemas.ts` — add `MarkCompleteSchema` (empty object) + export in `TASK_AGENT_TOOL_SCHEMAS`
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/tools/space-task-node-agent-tools.ts` (or equivalent wiring site) — mirror the `mark_complete` tool onto spawned post-approval sessions' MCP surface so the spawned agent can close the task

**Workflow schema**
- `packages/shared/src/types/space.ts` — add `PostApprovalRoute`, `WorkflowDefinition.postApproval`
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/post-approval-validator.ts` — NEW: `targetAgent` validator
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/post-approval-template.ts` — NEW: `instructions` interpolator
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/workflows/built-in-workflows.ts` — populate `postApproval` on Coding, Research, QA

**Runtime completion-resolution (to delete / simplify)**
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/space-runtime.ts` — replace `resolveCompletionWithActions` with `resolveTaskApproval`
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/completion-action-executors.ts` — full file

- `packages/daemon/src/lib/space/runtime/post-approval-router.ts` — NEW: orchestrates target-agent spawn

**RPC layer**
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/space-task-handlers.ts` — `spaceTask.update` intercept, `approvePendingCompletion` (new target = `approved`, then calls `PostApprovalRouter.route`). No new RPC.

**Shared types**
- `packages/shared/src/types/space.ts` — `TaskStatus` (add `approved`), `CompletionAction` (remove), `SpaceTask`, `SpaceWorkflowRun`, `WorkflowDefinition`
- `packages/shared/src/space/workflow-autonomy.ts` — autonomy helpers

**Storage**
- `packages/daemon/src/storage/schema/migrations.ts` — add migrations (§4.4)
- `packages/daemon/src/storage/repositories/space-task-repository.ts` — `postApprovalSessionId`, `postApprovalStartedAt`, `postApprovalBlockedReason` columns
- `packages/daemon/src/storage/repositories/space-workflow-run-repository.ts` — drop `completionActionsFiredAt`

**Web UI**
- `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingCompletionActionBanner.tsx` — delete
- `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingPostApprovalBanner.tsx` — NEW: one-line "post-approval in progress" / "post-approval failed" banner (§4.7)
- `packages/web/src/components/space/InlineStatusBanner.tsx` — NEW: shared single-line banner primitive (§4.7.4)
- `packages/web/src/lib/task-banner.ts` — NEW: `resolveActiveTaskBanner` precedence helper (§4.7.2)
- `packages/web/src/components/space/TaskStatusActions.tsx` — swap banners; use precedence helper
- `packages/web/src/components/space/SpaceTaskPane.tsx` — replace 3-conditional banner stack with single precedence-driven slot (§4.7)
- `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingGateBanner.tsx` — trim to single-line compose of `InlineStatusBanner`; inline description / error move into the Review modal
- `packages/web/src/components/space/PendingTaskCompletionBanner.tsx` — trim to single-line compose of `InlineStatusBanner`; agent rationale moves behind new Details modal
- `packages/web/src/components/space/TaskBlockedBanner.tsx` — trim every variant to a single-line compose; long error messages move into a Details modal (`gate_rejected` variant points at `GateArtifactsView`)
- `packages/web/src/lib/space-store.ts` — drop completion-action helpers; add `approved` status helpers

## Appendix B — Decision audit trail

| Decision | Options considered | Chosen | Why |
|----------|--------------------|--------|-----|
| Post-approval executor: narrow MCP tool vs. workflow-declared target agent | (A) New `merge_pr` MCP tool on Task Agent; (B) Workflow declares `postApproval.targetAgent` + `instructions`, Task Agent spawns the target | **B** | Real-world post-approval (merge, deploy, publish) needs LLM-dynamic handling — CI waits, conflict resolution, retry logic. A narrow handler cannot do this. Agent-spawn model reuses workflow-agent session infrastructure for free. See §1.2 for full argument. |
| Eligible `targetAgent` values | (A) Any agent name; (B) Declared workflow agent + `task-agent`; (C) Declared workflow agent only | **B** | Constraining to agents the workflow already declared avoids ad-hoc config. `task-agent` as an explicit second option handles the "no workflow agent fits" escape hatch without needing new agent types. |
| Task lifecycle addition | (A) Reuse `review` → `done` with a post-approval sub-state; (B) Add new `approved` status; (C) Track post-approval progress on the workflow-run row, not the task | **B** | `approved` is semantically distinct from `review` (work is accepted, not pending) and from `done` (terminal). Making it a first-class status is simpler to reason about in UI and queries. See §1.3. |
| Template grammar | (A) Simple `{{var}}` substitute; (B) Full Handlebars; (C) JS expressions | **A** | Dumb substitute is sufficient because the LLM reading the prompt handles all the conditional logic. Handlebars + JS are overkill and create testing/security debt. |
| Merge executor: Task Agent LLM (direct) vs. Task Agent routes to reviewer | Original revision: Task Agent LLM calls `merge_pr` MCP tool directly. This revision: the runtime routes to reviewer (workflow-declared agent). | **Route to reviewer** | Task Agent stays a pure orchestrator. The reviewer agent (or any target) already has the Bash/git/gh toolkit — reuse rather than duplicate. |
| Routing trigger: Task Agent LLM tool-call vs. runtime dispatch | (A) New `spawn_post_approval_session` + `completePostApproval` MCP tools on the Task Agent server; LLM decides when to spawn/complete. (B) New `PostApprovalRouter` in the runtime layer; triggered deterministically on the `approved` transition. | **B** | Routing is a pure function of `workflow.postApproval` — there is no decision for an LLM to make. Putting dispatch behind an LLM tool call risks skip/mis-route. LLM judgement still fully present in the post-approval *work itself*. See §1.4 for full rationale. Decided by direct user feedback 2026-04-23. |
| Post-approval completion signal tool | (A) Overload `approve_task` — make it idempotent for `approved → done` when the task is already `approved`. (B) New dedicated `mark_complete` tool, status-restricted to `approved`. | **B** | Same tool with two meanings (work-approval vs. post-approval-done) is a confusing footgun for both prompt authors and LLMs. A separately-named tool makes intent explicit at the call site. `approve_task` stays scoped to `in_progress → approved`. Decided by direct user feedback 2026-04-23. |
| Terminology for per-node workflow agents | (A) "workflow role" / "workflow-agent role". (B) "space task node agent". | **B** | User preference. The codebase currently uses `'node_agent'` kind in `SpaceMemberSession`; the new `post-approval-router.ts` doc comment introduces the long-form name for prose and cross-references the existing kind enum. |
| Approval banner composition | (A) Keep the current three independent conditionals in `SpaceTaskPane` (gate, completion-action, task-completion), each allowed to stack. (B) Single precedence-driven slot — at most one banner renders at a time, chosen by `resolveActiveTaskBanner`. | **B** | Per-task, gate-approval and task-approval cannot coexist in time — the gate blocks the run, so `submit_for_approval` only fires once gates have cleared. The independent-render code is defensive noise and produces visual clutter. Single-slot precedence matches the actual state machine. Decided by direct user feedback 2026-04-23. |
| Banner content density | (A) Multi-line banners with inline rationale / error / artifact summaries. (B) One-line banner + modal for any additional info. | **B** | Banners are status indicators, not control panels. Long-form content (agent rationale, gate artifacts, error traces) belongs behind a `[Details]` / `[Review]` modal, not stacked inline. Enforced by the shared `<InlineStatusBanner>` primitive (§4.7.4). Decided by direct user feedback 2026-04-23. |
| Handoff signal: new gate vs. structured send_message | Unchanged from original revision. | **send_message(task-agent, data)** | Already idiomatic; gates don't fit the task-agent's implicit channels. |
| `completionAutonomyLevel`: keep, repurpose, or remove | Unchanged. | **Keep** | Independently controls `approve_task` vs `submit_for_approval` — a distinct "is the work any good" decision from post-approval. |
| Verification completion actions (verify-pr-merged, verify-review-posted, verify-tasks-created): keep, convert, delete | Unchanged. | **Delete** (accept regression) | Lost verifications are soft guardrails; audit artifacts + human review are the primary safety nets. |
| Feature-flag the new routing | (A) Ship enabled by default; (B) Behind flag during PR 2, flip in PR 3 | **B** | Allows the runtime code to exist and be tested without any workflow template depending on it. De-risks the staged rollout. |
| QA workflow `completionAutonomyLevel` | Keep 4 vs. drop to 3 | **Drop to 3** | QA no longer merges. Auto-merge autonomy is a separate dimension enforced via the post-approval session's own autonomy-aware template. |
