# Anthropic-Copilot Provider Setup

This document covers how to configure the `anthropic-copilot` provider in NeoKai, which bridges to GitHub Copilot as an Anthropic-compatible API.

## Overview

The `anthropic-copilot` provider exposes GitHub Copilot as an Anthropic-compatible API endpoint. This allows NeoKai to use Copilot models (like `claude-opus-4.6`, `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gpt-5-mini`) through the standard Anthropic API interface.

### What It Does

- Exposes Copilot models via an Anthropic-shaped `/v1/messages` endpoint
- Bridges tool-use/tool-result calls to Copilot's native tool system
- Supports streaming responses via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

### Provider Capability Flags

| Capability | `anthropic` | `anthropic-copilot` |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Streaming | ✅ | ✅ |
| Function Calling | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vision | ✅ | ❌ |
| Extended Thinking | ✅ | ❌ |

## Authentication Methods

The provider discovers GitHub credentials in the following order:

1. **`~/.neokai/auth.json`** — Stored credentials from a previously completed NeoKai GitHub OAuth device flow
2. **`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`** — Environment variable with a fine-grained PAT
3. **`GH_TOKEN`** — Environment variable (fallback)
4. **`gh auth token`** — CLI command output
5. **`~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`** — OAuth token from GitHub CLI configuration

> **Important:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable (used by GitHub Actions) is **NOT** used — it lacks the required `copilot_requests` scope. Classic PATs (tokens starting with `ghp_`) are **hard rejected** by the Copilot CLI.

### Option 1: NeoKai GitHub OAuth (Recommended)

NeoKai includes a built-in GitHub OAuth device flow specifically for Copilot authentication.

**To trigger the OAuth flow:**
1. Open NeoKai in your browser
2. Navigate to Settings → Authentication (or provider settings)
3. Look for "Connect GitHub" or similar option to initiate the OAuth flow
4. Complete the GitHub authorization in your browser

The OAuth token is stored in `~/.neokai/auth.json` and automatically used on subsequent sessions.

### Option 2: COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN Environment Variable

> **Important:** You MUST use a **fine-grained PAT**, not a classic PAT. Classic PATs (starting with `ghp_`) are hard rejected by the GitHub Copilot CLI.

Set a fine-grained Personal Access Token:

```bash
# In your shell or .env file
export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_your_token_here
```

To create a fine-grained PAT:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
2. Generate new token with:
   - Token name: NeoKai Copilot
   - Repository access: All repositories
   - Permissions: Copilot (Access: read/write)

> **Note:** Classic PATs (starting with `ghp_`) are NOT supported and will be rejected with the error: "Classic PATs (ghp_...) are not supported by the GitHub Copilot CLI."

### Option 3: GH_TOKEN Environment Variable

If you have a fine-grained GitHub token already set in your environment:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=github_pat_your_token_here
```

### Option 4: gh auth login

If you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
```

The provider will use `gh auth token` to retrieve your authentication token. This returns an OAuth token (not a classic PAT), which is supported.

### Option 5: ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml

If you've authenticated via GitHub CLI, your OAuth token is stored in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`. The provider automatically reads the `oauth_token` from this file.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Authentication Method

For most users, **Option 1 (NeoKai GitHub OAuth)** is recommended:
1. Open NeoKai settings and initiate the GitHub OAuth flow
2. Authorize NeoKai to access your GitHub account for Copilot
3. Credentials are stored automatically

### Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

1. Install GitHub CLI if not installed: `brew install gh`
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Ensure Copilot is enabled in your GitHub account settings
4. The provider will automatically discover your token

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

Start NeoKai and check the provider status in the UI. You should see Copilot models available when:
- The provider indicator shows green (authenticated)
- Copilot models appear in the model picker

## Troubleshooting

### Classic PAT Rejection

**Symptom:** Authentication fails with error: "Classic PATs (ghp_...) are not supported by the GitHub Copilot CLI."

**Cause:** You're using a classic PAT (token starting with `ghp_`). Classic PATs are hard rejected by Copilot.

**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Delete any classic PATs you may have created
3. Create a **fine-grained token** instead:
   - Token name: NeoKai Copilot
   - Repository access: All repositories
   - Permissions: Copilot (Access: read/write)
4. Use the new fine-grained token (starts with `github_pat_`, not `ghp_`)

### Token Validation Failures

**Symptom:** "Token validation failed" or similar authentication error

**Cause:** Tokens obtained via `gh auth token` or `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` are OAuth tokens that must be exchanged for a Copilot session token.

**Solution:**
- The provider automatically performs this exchange for tokens from sources 4 and 5
- For enterprise GitHub accounts, ensure Copilot is enabled in your organization

### Enterprise GitHub

**Symptom:** Authentication works but returns no models or "Copilot not enabled"

**Cause:** Your GitHub Enterprise organization may have Copilot disabled or require additional permissions.

**Solution:**
1. Contact your organization admin to enable Copilot
2. Ensure you have Copilot access granted in your organization settings
3. For enterprise-managed users, you may need to use a fine-grained PAT with organization-specific scopes

### Linux Specific: Node.js Version

**Symptom:** Provider fails to start on Linux with "node:sqlite" module error

**Cause:** The Copilot CLI subprocess requires Node.js >= 22.5.0 with `node:sqlite` support.

**Solution:**
- On Linux, ensure Node.js 22 LTS or Node.js 24 is installed and available on PATH
- On macOS, this is handled automatically by Bun

## Known Limitations

### No Vision Support

The Copilot bridge does **not** support image input or multimodal content. Attempting to send images will result in an error.

### No Extended Thinking

Extended thinking (thinking blocks in API responses) is not supported by Copilot and therefore not available through this bridge.

### Heuristic Token Counting

Token usage (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`) is estimated based on character count (1 token ≈ 4 characters) rather than actual counts from Copilot. This is due to SDK limitations.

### tool_choice Limitations

The `tool_choice` parameter is accepted for API compatibility but is **not honored** by the Copilot bridge. The model will decide which tool to use regardless of the parameter value.

### Request Parameter Restrictions

The following Anthropic API parameters are not forwarded to Copilot:
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`
- `stop_sequences`
- Advanced sampling controls

### Non-Streaming Not Supported

The bridge requires `stream=true`. Requests with `stream=false` will receive a 400 error.
