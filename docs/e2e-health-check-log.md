# E2E Test Health Check Log

This document tracks findings from recurring CI health check missions on the `dev` branch.

## 2026-03-22 — Check Run #23408422793 (first analysis)

### CI Run Overview
- **Run ID**: 23408422793
- **Branch**: dev (commit 1eb2cf653 — before fixes)
- **Status**: Completed with e2e failures

### Build/Discover Jobs
All passed:
- `build` — Build web bundle: **PASSED**
- `discover` — Discover E2E tests: **PASSED**
- `All Tests Pass` — Status aggregator: **PASSED** (but downstream jobs had failures)

### E2E Test Failures at #23408422793

**11 failing tests** — all in `features-mission-terminology` suite. Root causes identified and fixed in PR #717 (see below).

---

## 2026-03-22 — Check Run #23408701119 (post-fix push)

### CI Run Overview
- **Run ID**: 23408701119
- **Branch**: dev (commit 1eb2cf653 — same as above, pre-fix baseline)
- **Event**: push to dev
- **Status**: Completed with **1 failure**

### Build/Discover Jobs
- `Discover Tests`: **PASSED**
- `Build Binary (linux-x64)`: **PASSED**
- `Lint, Knip, Format & Type Check`: **SKIPPED** (likely gated by build)
- All unit test jobs: **SKIPPED**

### E2E Test Failures at #23408701119

**1 failing test**: `E2E LLM (features-worktree-isolation)` → `should cleanup worktree when session is deleted`

**Failure**: After deleting a session and confirming deletion, the page URL still contains the deleted session ID:
```
Expect "not toHaveURL" with timeout 10000ms
14 × unexpected value "http://localhost:39747/session/461d5dd2-7c5c-4a22-bccf-7bf11e853df2"
at worktree-isolation.e2e.ts:113
```

**Root cause**: Race condition in session deletion flow — after clicking confirm delete, the app does not immediately navigate away from the deleted session page. The `toHaveURL` assertion fires before the redirect completes (or the redirect never fires).

**Impact**: Pre-existing flake, unrelated to the Goals→Missions / LiveQuery changes in PR #717.

**Note**: This run (#23408701119) was on the same pre-fix baseline (1eb2cf653). The fixes from PR #717 have not yet been merged to dev. A new run will be triggered once PR #717 is merged.

### Previous E2E Failures (from #23408422793, now fixed in PR #717)

#### Root Cause 1: UI Terminology Mismatch
E2E tests (mission-terminology suite, 11 failing tests) were written expecting **"Missions"** labels in the UI, but the actual UI implementation used **"Goals"** terminology. This is inconsistent with the Mission System documentation in `CLAUDE.md` which specifies "Mission" as the canonical V2 term.

**Files changed**: `packages/web/src/islands/Room.tsx`, `packages/web/src/islands/RoomContextPanel.tsx`, `packages/web/src/components/room/GoalsEditor.tsx`

**Fix**: Renamed all UI labels from "Goals" to "Missions" to match test expectations and Mission System terminology.

#### Root Cause 2: LiveQuery Task Notification Gap
`TaskRepository` was missing `reactiveDb.notifyChange('tasks')` calls after all mutation methods:
- `createTask` — no notifyChange
- `updateTask` — no notifyChange
- `deleteTask` — no notifyChange
- `archiveTask` — no notifyChange
- `promoteDraftTasksByCreator` — no notifyChange

This meant LiveQuery subscriptions never fired when tasks were created/modified via RPC handlers, causing `roomStore.tasks.value` to remain empty in e2e tests.

**Files changed**:
- `packages/daemon/src/storage/repositories/task-repository.ts` — added `reactiveDb` param + notifyChange calls
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/task-manager.ts` — pass `this.reactiveDb`
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/room-manager.ts` — add `reactiveDb` param, pass to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/goal-manager.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/task-handlers.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/index.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to RoomManager
- Unit/integration tests: all updated to pass `reactiveDb` / `noOpReactiveDb`

### PR
- **PR**: https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/717
- **Status**: Open, fixes committed — awaiting merge to dev to trigger post-fix CI run

### Pre-existing Flake: worktree-isolation session deletion
- **Test**: `should cleanup worktree when session is deleted` (features/worktree-isolation.e2e.ts:113)
- **Issue**: Race condition — page URL still contains deleted session ID after deletion confirmation
- **Action needed**: Increase timeout or add explicit wait for navigation after session deletion

## 2026-03-22 — Check Run #23412078420 (post-PR#717 merge)

### CI Run Overview
- **Run ID**: 23412078420
- **Branch**: dev (commit 0ad39bc01 — after PR #717 fix)
- **Event**: push
- **Status**: Completed with e2e failures

### E2E Test Failures at #23412078420

**17 failing tests** across 4 test suites. All failures are **test code bugs** introduced by PR #717, not genuine product bugs.

#### Root Cause: Ambiguous Playwright Locator for "Missions" Button

**Problem**: After renaming "Goals" → "Missions" in the UI, the locator `button:has-text("Missions")` now resolves to **2 elements** in strict mode:
1. `<button aria-label="Missions section">` — sidebar CollapsibleSection header button
2. `<button>Missions</button>` — room tab bar button

Playwright's strict mode fails when a locator matches multiple elements. This affects all tests that use the ambiguous locator in room page contexts.

**Fix**: Replace `button:has-text("Missions")` with `getByRole('button', { name: 'Missions', exact: true })` in all affected test files. The sidebar button has `aria-label="Missions section"` (accessible name = "Missions section"), so it will NOT match the exact name selector.

**Affected tests** (all failing due to ambiguous locator):
| Test Suite | Failing Tests | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `features-mission-terminology` | 5/5 | Ambiguous `button:has-text("Missions")` locator |
| `features-mission-creation` | 9/9 | Same — shared `openMissionsTab` helper |
| `features-livequery-task-goal-updates` | 2/2 | Same — direct locator use |
| `features-mission-detail` | (not failing in this run but affected) | Same — shared helper |
| `features-task-goal-indicator` | (passing but affected) | Same — uses `h2:has-text("Missions")` (safe) |

#### Root Cause 2: Space Workspace Path Issue (features-space-session-groups)

**1 failing test**: `Working Agents section is hidden when no session groups exist`

```
Error: page.evaluate: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
at createTestSpaceWithTask (/home/runner/work/neokai/neokai/packages/e2e/tests/features/space-session-groups.e2e.ts:55:14)
```

**Root cause**: The `space.create` RPC returns `undefined` because the workspace path (`/tmp/tmp.3fwp0Bczum`) is not a git repository. The daemon rejects space creation in non-git directories.

**Context**: The test uses `getWorkspaceRoot(page)` to get the workspace path, which returns the server's workspace root. In CI, this may be a temp path that isn't properly initialized as a git repo.

**Status**: Only 1 test in the suite failed (the first test, `Working Agents section is hidden when no session groups exist`). All other tests in the suite passed (implying the space creation succeeded in subsequent runs). This is a **suspected flaky** issue — likely a race condition or environment initialization timing issue in CI.

**Action needed**: Investigate whether `space.create` should gracefully handle non-git workspace paths, or whether the test should use a dedicated git workspace. This may be an env issue rather than a test code bug.

#### Pre-existing Flakes (still present)

- **worktree-isolation session deletion**: Race condition in session deletion navigation (still failing)
- **space-session-groups workspace path**: Likely env/race condition issue (1 failure in this run)

## 2026-03-27 — Check Run #23660910158

### CI Run Overview
- **Run ID**: 23660910158
- **Branch**: dev (commit 8fe82aaf — `feat(space): implement completion flow with Done node summary (M5.2) (#1050)`)
- **Event**: push
- **Status**: Completed with e2e failures

### Build/Discover Jobs
- `Discover Tests`: **PASSED**
- `Build Binary (linux-x64)`: **PASSED**
- All unit test jobs: **SKIPPED** (gated by build prerequisites)

### E2E Test Failures at #23660910158

**Note on job naming**: The E2E job names in this report (e.g., `E2E No-LLM (features-space-agent-centric-workflow)`) are derived from the discovered test suite identifiers used as artifact names, not from the GitHub API top-level job list. The E2E matrix uses dynamic job expansion via `needs.discover.outputs`, and the API may not surface all matrix child jobs at the top level. Artifact names (e.g., `e2e-no-llm-results-features-space-agent-centric-workflow`) confirm the suites ran and failed.

**4 failing tests** across 3 suites. All failures were on a pre-PR#1044 baseline.

#### 1. `features-space-agent-centric-workflow` — `clickedNode is not defined`
**Test**: `Multi-agent node renders agent badges and completion state structure`
**Error**: `ReferenceError: clickedNode is not defined` at line 243

```
241 | // addStep double-invocation issue, nodes.first() picks the old/duplicate node
242 | // rather than the one that was just configured in the panel.
243 > const node = clickedNode;
```

**Root cause**: Test code bug — `clickedNode` variable was never defined. Left over from PR #1011 `hasNot`→`:not()` selector refactor which removed the variable declaration but left the reference.

**Fix**: Already fixed in PR #1044 (`d7145d27f`) — replaced `clickedNode` with `nodes.first()`.

---

#### 2. `features-space-creation` — `text=Quick Actions` not visible (flaky)
**Test**: `creates space and shows tabbed dashboard layout`
**Error**: `locator('text=Quick Actions').toBeVisible()` timeout after 5s

**Root cause**: Timing/race condition — the dashboard tabbed layout loaded but "Quick Actions" text wasn't visible in time. No subsequent non-cancelled CI run exists to verify (all runs after #23660910158 were cancelled), so this is currently classified as **suspected flaky** pending the next successful run.

**Status**: Suspected flaky — requires verification in the next non-cancelled CI run.

---

#### 3. `features-reference-autocomplete` — Worktree creation fails (no git repo)
**Tests**: `clicking a task result inserts @ref{task:…}`, `clicking a goal result inserts @ref{goal:…}`, `keyboard navigation`, `task and goal both appear`, and `does not show autocomplete for plain text input` (12+ failures with retries)

**Error** (repeating for every test):
```
[kai:daemon:worktreemanager] No .git found traversing from: /tmp/tmp.zRQ3QaHVJs
[kai:daemon:worktreemanager] createWorktree: no git root found for repoPath=/tmp/tmp.zRQ3QaHVJs
[kai:daemon:room-runtime] Failed to spawn planning group for goal <id>: Error: Worktree creation failed — task requires isolation
[kai:daemon:room-runtime] Goal <id> (Insert Goal) exceeded max planning attempts (1), marking needs_human
```

**Root cause**: The E2E test workspace path (`/tmp/tmp.*`) is not a git repository. `WorktreeManager.findGitRoot()` returns `null`, causing `createWorktree` to fail. This cascades: tasks can't be created → autocomplete results are empty → tests time out waiting for dropdown items.

**Impact**: All reference-autocomplete tests that navigate to room agent chat fail. Also triggers cascade failures in task-lifecycle (see below).

**Status**: Unresolved — this issue was already noted in the 2026-03-22 health check log. The root cause has not been addressed. Also see Root Cause 2 below.

**PR#1044 context**: PR #1044 moved `reference-autocomplete` from discover-only (No-LLM) to `LLM_TESTS` in the workflow matrix. This means it now runs in E2E LLM jobs alongside LLM-required tests. However, the underlying worktree/git-repo issue persists — the test still fails in both LLM and No-LLM matrices because task creation (via the room agent) requires isolated git worktrees.

---

#### 4. `features-task-lifecycle` — Cascade from worktree failure
**Tests**: `archives completed task and it disappears from Done tab`, `archived task appears in Archived tab, not Done tab`

**Error**:
```
TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
Call log: waiting for getByRole('button', { name: /Done/ })
```

**Root cause**: Cascade failure — the preceding test (or test setup) creates tasks via the room agent, which requires isolated git worktrees. Since the E2E workspace has no `.git`, tasks are never created → the Done tab never shows a completed task → archive assertions fail.

**Fix**: Resolves automatically when the `features-reference-autocomplete` worktree issue is fixed.

---

### Previous Failures (from #23412078420, now fixed)

| Test | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `features-space-agent-centric-workflow` | `clickedNode` undefined | PR #1044 — `d7145d27f` |
| `features-task-lifecycle` (archive tests) | Archived tab removed in #1016, LiveQuery filtering | PR #1044 — `d7145d27f` |

### Unresolved Issue: Worktree/GitRepo in E2E CI

The `features-reference-autocomplete` suite and its cascade failures (`features-task-lifecycle` archive tests) both stem from the same root cause: **E2E temp workspaces lack a `.git` directory**, preventing `WorktreeManager` from creating isolated worktrees for task planning.

This was first documented in the 2026-03-22 health check log and remains unresolved.

**Options to resolve**:
1. **Test fix**: Initialize the E2E temp workspace as a git repo before running tests (e.g., `git init` in the test setup)
2. **Backend fix**: Allow task creation without git worktree isolation for non-git workspaces
3. **Skip**: Mark tests requiring task isolation as LLM-only and ensure the No-LLM matrix excludes them

#### Root Cause Analysis — 8 Distinct Failure Categories

---

##### Category 1: Neo Panel Dialog Blocks Escape Key / Dialog Close (affects 7 suites)

**Pattern**: Tests try to dismiss a dialog (typically the Neo AI panel `data-testid="neo-panel"`) by pressing Escape, but the panel stays visible. Tests use a helper like `createSessionViaNewSessionButton` that calls `page.keyboard.press('Escape')` then `expect(anyDialog).toBeHidden()`, but the Neo panel doesn't close.

**Failure signature**:
```
Expect "toBeHidden" with timeout 3000ms
locator('[role="dialog"]:visible') resolved to <div role="dialog" ... data-testid="neo-panel" ... class="... -translate-x-full">...</div>
```

**Affected suites** (7 jobs):
| Suite | Failed Tests | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `features-provider-model-switching` | 8/8 | All tests fail at `createSessionViaNewSessionButton` |
| `settings-tools-modal` | 3/3 | Same — Neo panel blocks Escape |
| `features-neo-panel` | 2/2 | Neo panel close behavior broken |
| `features-space-creation` | 3/3 | Dialog close fails — Neo panel persists |
| `settings-mcp-servers` | 3/3 | Session options menu blocked by Neo panel |
| `features-space-approval-gate-rejection` | 4/4 | Gate UI not visible — setup fails due to Neo panel |
| `features-neo-settings` | 1/1 | Settings navigation broken |

**Root cause**: `product-bug` — The Neo AI panel (`data-testid="neo-panel"`) intercepts or ignores Escape key events. Tests expect pressing Escape to close it via `locator('[role="dialog"]:visible').toBeHidden()`, but the panel remains visible (it has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`). The `createSessionViaNewSessionButton` helper in `provider-model-switching.e2e.ts` and similar shared helpers try to dismiss any open dialog before creating a session, but this fails because the Neo panel doesn't respond to Escape.

**Fix needed**: Either (a) fix the Neo panel to close on Escape, or (b) update test helpers to explicitly close the Neo panel before proceeding (e.g., click outside or call a dismiss function).

---

##### Category 2: Ambiguous Locators — Strict Mode Violations (affects 5 suites)

**Pattern**: Locators match multiple elements in Playwright strict mode, causing tests to fail.

**Failure signatures**:

1. `features-neo-settings`: `locator('h3:has-text("Neo Agent")').locator('..').locator('text=Clear Session')` resolved to **2 elements** — strict mode violation.
2. `features-space-agent-chat`: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Dashboard', exact: true })` resolved to **2 elements** — appears twice in the DOM.
3. `features-task-lifecycle`: `locator('[role="dialog"]')` resolved to **2 elements** — Neo panel dialog + archive dialog both match.
4. `features-space-task-creation`: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Dashboard', exact: true })` resolved to **2 elements** — same duplicate button issue.

**Affected suites** (5 jobs):
| Suite | Failed Tests | Primary Error | Also Affected By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `features-neo-settings` | 1 | `h3:has-text("Neo Agent")` → 2 elements | — |
| `features-space-agent-chat` | 2 | `Dashboard` button → 2 elements; textarea not hidden | — |
| `features-task-lifecycle` | 1 | `[role="dialog"]` → 2 elements (Neo panel + archive dialog) | — |
| `features-space-task-creation` | 4 | `Dashboard` button → 2 elements (strict mode) | Category 3 (space cleanup) |
| `features-space-context-panel-switching` | 2 | Space navigation fails — heading not visible | Category 3 (space cleanup) |

**Root cause**: `test-bug` — Locators are not specific enough. UI changes (likely adding the Neo panel or duplicate navigation elements) caused existing locators to resolve to multiple elements.

**Fix needed**: Make locators more specific:
- Use `getByRole('button', { name: 'Dashboard', exact: true }).nth(0)` or scope to a container
- Use `getByTestId('archive-dialog')` or scope `[role="dialog"]` to a specific parent
- Use `getByText('Clear Session').first()` or narrow the parent scope

---

##### Category 3: Space Creation — UNIQUE Constraint / Already Exists (affects 7 suites)

**Pattern**: Tests create spaces via RPC, but get `UNIQUE constraint failed: spaces.workspace_path` or `A space already exists for workspace path` errors. Tests don't clean up spaces from previous test runs or retries. Some suites also log `workspace path is not a git repository` warnings, which contributes to setup failures.

**Failure signature**:
```
Error: page.evaluate: Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: spaces.workspace_path
Error: page.evaluate: Error: A space already exists for workspace path: /tmp/tmp.6KrjG8hFj0
[kai:daemon:spacemanager] workspace path is not a git repository: /tmp/tmp.MLDoNKddkn
```

**Affected suites** (7 jobs):
| Suite | Failed Tests | Primary Error | Also Affected By |
|---|---|---|---|
| `features-space-happy-path-pipeline` | 1 | UNIQUE constraint on space creation | — |
| `features-space-navigation` | 2 | Space already exists for workspace path | — |
| `features-space-settings-crud` | 6 | Cascade — space creation fails in retries | — |
| `features-space-task-fullwidth` | 2 | Space already exists; workspace not a git repo | — |
| `features-space-task-creation` | 4 | Cascade — space creation fails | Category 2 (strict mode) |
| `features-space-context-panel-switching` | 2 | Space navigation fails after setup | Category 2 (strict mode) |
| `features-reviewer-feedback-loop` | 1 | Space setup fails — workflow canvas not visible | — |

**Root cause**: `test-bug` — Test cleanup (e.g., `afterEach` or `afterAll`) doesn't properly delete spaces created during the test. On retry, the same workspace path is reused but the space already exists in the DB.

**Fix needed**: Add proper space cleanup in test teardown. Use `beforeEach` with space deletion, or use unique workspace paths per test/attempt.

---

##### Category 4: Neo Chat — Provider Not Available / AI-Dependent Tests in No-LLM Matrix (affects 1 suite)

**Pattern**: Tests that send messages and expect AI responses fail because `Provider Anthropic is not available` — no credentials are configured in No-LLM jobs. The Neo chat tests send messages that trigger AI queries, which fail without credentials.

**Failure signature**:
```
Error: Provider Anthropic is not available. Please configure credentials.
MessageQueueTimeoutError: SDK did not consume message ... within 30s
```

**Affected suite**:
| Suite | Failed Tests | Error |
|---|---|---|
| `features-neo-chat-rendering` | 3/5 | AI-dependent tests timeout — provider not available |

**Note**: 2 tests passed (empty state, user message rendering) — these don't require AI responses. The 3 failing tests expect assistant messages (sparkle avatar, readable text, empty state disappearing after send).

**Root cause**: `test-bug` — AI-dependent tests are classified as No-LLM but require Anthropic credentials. These should either be moved to the LLM matrix, or the Neo chat should be mocked in No-LLM tests.

**Fix needed**: Move the AI-dependent Neo chat rendering tests to the LLM matrix, or mock the AI response in No-LLM mode.

---

##### Category 5: Visual Workflow Editor — Toggle Mode Not Working (affects 1 suite)

**Pattern**: Clicking the toggle button to switch between List and Visual modes doesn't activate the expected mode.

**Failure signature**:
```
Expect "toHaveAttribute" with timeout 60000ms
element(s) not found
```

**Affected suite**:
| Suite | Failed Tests | Error |
|---|---|---|
| `features-visual-workflow-editor` | 1 | Toggle button click doesn't switch mode |

**Root cause**: `product-bug` or `test-bug` — The toggle button for switching between list/visual modes doesn't work as expected. The test waits 60s for an attribute to appear but the element is never found. Could be a selector issue or the toggle feature is broken.

**Fix needed**: Investigate whether the toggle button selector is correct and whether the feature actually works.

---

##### Category 6: Space Multi-Agent Editor — Missing Workflow Node (affects 1 suite)

**Pattern**: After editing a step to add a second agent, the visual workflow editor only shows 1 node instead of 2.

**Failure signature**:
```
Expect "toHaveCount" with timeout 3000ms
getByTestId('visual-workflow-editor').locator('[data-testid^="workflow-node-"]') resolved to 1 element
unexpected value "1"
```

**Affected suite**:
| Suite | Failed Tests | Error |
|---|---|---|
| `features-space-multi-agent-editor` | 1 | Expected 2 workflow nodes, got 1 |

**Root cause**: `product-bug` or `test-bug` — The test adds a second agent to a workflow step but the visual editor doesn't render the new node. Could be a rendering bug or the agent addition didn't actually persist.

**Fix needed**: Verify that the agent addition API call succeeds and that the visual editor re-renders correctly.

---

##### Category 7: Space Agent-Centric Workflow — No .git / Toggle Button Timeout (affects 1 suite)

**Pattern**: The test clicks `getByTestId('toggle-channels-button')` in the visual workflow editor but it never becomes clickable within 60s. The workspace is not a git repo (`No .git found traversing from: /tmp/tmp.*`), which may prevent proper workspace initialization.

**Failure signature**:
```
TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
waiting for getByTestId('visual-workflow-editor').getByTestId('toggle-channels-button')
[kai:daemon:worktreemanager] No .git found traversing from: /tmp/tmp.ZsQdtuAXRs
```

**Affected suite**:
| Suite | Failed Tests | Error |
|---|---|---|
| `features-space-agent-centric-workflow` | 1 | Toggle channels button never becomes clickable |

**Root cause**: `env` / `test-bug` — The workspace is not a git repo, which may cause space setup to partially fail. The toggle-channels-button in the visual workflow editor is never rendered or clickable.

**Fix needed**: Ensure the workspace is initialized as a git repo before the test runs (same fix as Category 8 for reference-autocomplete).

---

##### Category 8: Reference Autocomplete — No .git in E2E Workspace (pre-existing, 1 suite)

**Pattern**: All reference-autocomplete tests fail because the E2E temp workspace (`/tmp/tmp.*`) is not a git repository. `WorktreeManager.findGitRoot()` returns null, preventing worktree creation for task isolation.

**Affected suite**:
| Suite | Failed Tests | Error |
|---|---|---|
| `features-reference-autocomplete` (LLM) | 30 | No `.git` in temp workspace — worktree creation fails |

**Root cause**: `env` — Pre-existing issue documented in 2026-03-22 and 2026-03-27 health check logs. E2E CI workspaces lack a `.git` directory.

**Status**: Unresolved pre-existing issue.

---

| Space agent-centric workflow — toggle button timeout | `env` / `test-bug` | 1 suite (space-agent-centric-workflow) |

### Priority Recommendations

1. **HIGH — Neo panel Escape key** (affects 7 suites): Fix the Neo panel to close on Escape, or update all test helpers that rely on Escape-to-dismiss.
2. **HIGH — Space cleanup in tests** (affects 7 suites): Add proper `afterEach`/`afterAll` space deletion to prevent UNIQUE constraint violations on retry.
3. **HIGH — E2E workspace missing .git** (affects 2 suites: reference-autocomplete, space-agent-centric-workflow): Initialize E2E temp workspace as a git repo before tests run.
4. **MEDIUM — Ambiguous locators** (affects 5 suites): Make locators more specific to avoid strict mode violations with Neo panel dialogs.
5. **LOW — Neo chat AI tests in No-LLM** (1 suite): Reclassify or mock AI responses.
6. **LOW — Visual editor / multi-agent editor** (2 suites): Investigate individually.

### Root Cause Analysis

All 21 pre-existing failures are identical to those documented in run #23904270931. Same root cause categories apply (see that entry for details). Below is only the **new** failure.

---

#### New Failure: `features-app-mcp-registry` — Strict Mode Violation **[NEW]**

**Test**: `should show disabled globally badge for brave-search in room settings` (line 207)

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed
Locator: locator('text=disabled globally')
Expected: visible
Error: strict mode violation: locator('text=disabled globally') resolved to 2 elements:
  1) <span class="text-xs px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded bg-dark-700 text-gray-500">disabled globally</span> aka getByText('disabled globally').first()
  2) <span class="text-xs px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded bg-dark-700 text-gray-500">disabled globally</span> aka getByText('disabled globally').nth(1)
```

**Root cause**: `test-bug` — Ambiguous locator `text=disabled globally` matches 2 elements. This is the same category of strict mode violation documented as Category 2 in run #23904270931.

**Fix needed**: Use `.first()` or a more specific scoped locator, e.g., `page.locator('text=disabled globally').first()`.

**Cancelled**: `E2E No-LLM (features-neo-conversation)` — cancelled after 10+ min (likely timeout)

### Root Cause Analysis

All 22 pre-existing failures are identical to those documented in runs #23904270931 and #23912077742. Same root cause categories apply (see those entries for details). Below is only the **new** failure.

---

#### New Failure: `core-connection-resilience` — WebSocket Reconnect Timeouts **[NEW]**

**Tests**: All 3 tests fail:
1. `messages generated during disconnection are displayed upon reconnection`
2. `preserves message order after multiple disconnect-reconnect cycles`
3. `handles rapid connect-disconnect cycles`

**Error**:
```
TimeoutError: page.waitForFunction: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
```

**Root cause**: `flaky` / `env` — All 3 tests in this suite involve WebSocket disconnection/reconnection and use `page.waitForFunction()` to wait for reconnection state. The tests were passing in run #23912077742 (not in the failing list). This is likely a CI timing/infrastructure issue — the WebSocket reconnection may be slow in this particular CI environment, causing the 60s timeout to be exceeded.

**Note**: This suite was **not failing** in run #23912077742 (just 2 commits earlier). The only code change between runs is `fed2a6f88` (NodeExecutionRepository), which is unrelated to WebSocket/connection logic. This strongly suggests a **flaky** classification.

### Root Cause A — SpaceDashboard hidden by seeded WorkflowCanvas

**Background**: On space creation, built-in workflows are seeded into `spaceWorkflow`. In `SpaceIsland.tsx`, `const showCanvas = defaultWorkflow !== null` — so any seeded workflow sets `showCanvas=true`. When `showCanvas=true`, the canvas div has `hidden md:flex` and the SpaceDashboard div has `md:hidden`, making the Dashboard invisible at the 1280×720 viewport used by E2E tests. Tests that expect to see tabs, the Overview button, or the space task list therefore time out.

**Failing suites** (5):
| Suite | Failing Tests |
|---|---|
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-navigation)` | `navigates between spaces`, `shows space dashboard on overview click` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-task-fullwidth)` | `expands task to fullwidth view`, `fullwidth panel shows task details` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-task-creation)` | `creates task from space dashboard`, `task appears in task list after creation` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-creation)` | `creates space and shows tabbed dashboard layout`, `space shows Quick Actions` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-happy-path-pipeline)` | `end-to-end space pipeline`, `creates and assigns task` |

Note: `features-space-creation`, `features-space-task-fullwidth`, and `features-space-task-creation` also have Root Cause D failures (see below); both root causes affect those suites.

**Fix**: Delete seeded built-in workflows in E2E `beforeEach` so `defaultWorkflow` stays `null` → `showCanvas=false` → dashboard is visible.
**Fix PR**: [#1356](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1356) — `fix(e2e): delete seeded workflows so SpaceDashboard is visible on desktop`
**Status**: Fix PR open, unmerged.

---

### Root Cause B — Ripgrep missing from CI sandbox dependencies

**Background**: The Claude SDK sandbox mode expects the `rg` binary at a vendor path (`/tmp/neokai-sdk/vendor/ripgrep/x64-linux/rg`). The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) installs `bubblewrap` and `socat` but **not** `ripgrep`. When the SDK subprocess starts in CI, it immediately fails with a missing `rg` error, causing all tests that require a live SDK session to time out.

**Failing No-LLM suites** (2 — sandbox error confirmed in logs):
| Suite | Failing Tests |
|---|---|
| `E2E No-LLM (core-connection-resilience)` | `messages generated during disconnection are displayed upon reconnection`, `preserves message order after multiple disconnect-reconnect cycles`, `handles rapid connect-disconnect cycles` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-provider-model-switching)` | `switches model in model selector`, `provider list is populated`, and 6 others |

**Failing LLM suites** (8 confirmed failed; 3 were cancelled — see above):
| Suite | Classification |
|---|---|
| `E2E LLM (core-model-selection)` | Likely sandbox — session never starts |
| `E2E LLM (features-file-operations)` | Likely sandbox |
| `E2E LLM (features-session-operations)` | Likely sandbox |
| `E2E LLM (features-message-operations)` | Likely sandbox |
| `E2E LLM (features-reference-autocomplete)` | Likely sandbox (also affected by no-git-repo issue) |
| `E2E LLM (core-message-flow)` | Tentative — may be product regression |
| `E2E LLM (responsive-tablet)` | Tentative — may be product regression |
| `E2E LLM (settings-auto-title)` | Tentative — may be product regression |

**Caveat**: The 8 LLM failures are attributed to ripgrep as the most likely cause, but per-test logs would be needed to confirm. `core-message-flow`, `responsive-tablet`, and `settings-auto-title` in particular could be unrelated product regressions — they were not in the previous run's failing list and their failure mode is not confirmed as sandbox-related.

**Fix**: Add `ripgrep` to the `sudo apt-get install -y bubblewrap socat` line in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
**Fix PR**: [#1351](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1351) — `ci: add ripgrep to CI sandbox dependencies`
**Status**: Fix PR open, unmerged.

---

### Root Cause C — `features-neo-conversation` needs same fixes as `features-neo-panel`

**Background**: PR #1297 fixed `neo-panel.e2e.ts` by adding proper close/Escape/backdrop/Cmd+J wait helpers. The companion suite `neo-conversation.e2e.ts` has the same timing assumptions and was NOT updated in PR #1297. (This suite was cancelled in the previous run #23914538827 and its failure was not confirmed until this run.)

**Failing suite** (1):
| Suite | Failing Tests |
|---|---|
| `E2E No-LLM (features-neo-conversation)` | `closes panel on X button click`, `closes panel on Escape key`, `closes panel on backdrop click`, `tab switching preserves conversation state` |

**Fix PR**: [#1357](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1357) — `fix(e2e): apply neo-panel timing fixes to neo-conversation.e2e.ts`
**Status**: Fix PR open, unmerged.

---

### Root Cause D — NeoPanel `role="dialog"` causes Playwright strict mode violations

**Background**: `SpaceDetailPanel.tsx` renders with `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`. Several E2E tests call `page.getByRole('dialog')`, which in strict mode fails when multiple `role="dialog"` elements are present. When navigating to space views, both the NeoPanel and the space detail panel may be in the DOM simultaneously.

**Failing suites** (3 — all overlap with Root Cause A; both root causes cause failures in the same suites):
| Suite | Failing Tests |
|---|---|
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-creation)` | `space detail shows after creation` — strict mode violation on `getByRole('dialog')` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-task-fullwidth)` | `fullwidth mode dialog transition` |
| `E2E No-LLM (features-space-task-creation)` | `task creation form dialog` |

**Fix PR**: [#1354](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1354) — `fix(e2e): use getModal() to fix NeoPanel role=dialog strict mode violations`
**Status**: Fix PR open, unmerged.

---

### Root Cause E — Individual test selector bugs and UI divergence

#### E1 — `features-space-settings-crud`: Invalid regex from path with slashes
**Tests**: All 6 tests that check `spaceWorkspacePath` visibility fail.
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Invalid flags supplied to RegExp constructor 'tmp/neokai/settings-1234'`
**Cause**: `page.locator('text=/tmp/neokai/settings-1234')` interprets the argument as a regex literal — the path slashes become regex delimiters and the suffix becomes invalid flags.
**Fix**: Replace with `page.getByText(spaceWorkspacePath, { exact: false })`.
**Fix PR**: [#1353](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1353)

#### E2 — `settings-tools-modal`: `aria-label` vs `title` attribute mismatch
**Tests**: `shows session options modal on button click`, `closes modal on X button click` (2 tests).
**Cause**: Test uses `button[aria-label="Session options"]` but the actual button has `title="Session options"`. The locator matches nothing, causing a timeout.
**Fix**: Replace with `page.getByTitle('Session options')`.
**Fix PR**: [#1353](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1353)

#### E3 — `features-space-agent-chat`: Textarea selector matches NeoPanel after navigation
**Tests**: `message input is not visible on overview tab` and 1 other (2 tests).
**Cause**: After navigating back to the Overview tab, `page.locator('textarea[placeholder*="Ask"]').first()` matches the NeoPanel's "Ask Neo…" textarea which remains mounted. `expect(messageInput).not.toBeVisible()` fails because that element IS visible.
**Fix**: Scope the selector to the chat container: `page.locator('[data-testid="chat-container"] textarea')`.
**Fix PR**: [#1355](https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/1355)

#### E4 — `features-space-agent-centric-workflow`, `features-space-context-panel-switching`: Navigation timeouts
**Tests**: `selectOption` timeout (1 test), space click navigation timeout (2 tests).
**Cause**: Timing issues in panel/tab navigation — likely exacerbated by the SpaceDashboard visibility issue (Root Cause A). May partially self-resolve once #1356 merges.
**Status**: Likely partially fixed by Root Cause A fix (#1356); no dedicated fix PR.

#### E5 — `features-space-approval-gate-rejection`, `features-reviewer-feedback-loop`, `features-space-multi-agent-editor`, `features-visual-workflow-editor`, `settings-mcp-servers`: UI divergence
**Tests**: Various (1–5 tests per suite).
**Cause**: Gate UI, multi-agent editor UI, or MCP settings UI changed in recent commits; test assertions reference old element structure or text that no longer exists.
**Status**: Requires individual investigation per suite — no fix PRs open yet.

### Root Cause A — `features-neo-chat-rendering`: `neo-empty-state` testid not found; stale message count

**Tests**:
- `shows empty state with Neo introduction before any messages` — line 69: `getByTestId('neo-empty-state').toBeVisible()` fails (element not found); line 78: `getByTestId(NEO_USER_MESSAGE_TESTID).toHaveCount(0)` fails (count = 1)
- `empty state disappears once a message is sent` — line 118: `getByTestId('neo-empty-state').not.toBeVisible()` fails (element not found)

**Errors**:
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed — element(s) not found
> 69 | await expect(emptyState).toBeVisible();   // neo-empty-state
> 78 | await expect(page.getByTestId(NEO_USER_MESSAGE_TESTID)).toHaveCount(0);  // actual: 1
> 118| await expect(page.getByTestId('neo-empty-state')).toBeVisible();
```

**Background log**: `Error: Claude Code returned an error result: Invalid API key · Fix external API key` — suggests Neo panel initialization triggered a real SDK session attempt in CI (no API key configured for No-LLM runs). This may cause a system error message to appear as `NEO_USER_MESSAGE_TESTID` element, explaining why count is 1 not 0.

**Likely cause**: Either (a) the `neo-empty-state` testid was renamed/removed from the UI in a recent commit, or (b) Neo panel initialization fires an automatic greeting message that creates a user-message element even before any explicit message is sent. Needs UI source inspection (`NeoPanel`, `NeoChatView` or equivalent component).

**Fix needed**: Inspect `packages/web/src/` for `neo-empty-state` testid; if removed, update test to use the current empty-state testid or selector. If a system init message is being created, ensure test isolation prevents it.

---

### Root Cause B — `features-neo-conversation`: Two distinct failures

**Tests**:
1. `navigates to Conservative and back to Balanced` — line 406: strict mode violation on `locator('text=Security mode updated')`
2. `can switch to activity view and back to chat` — line 555: `getByTestId(NEO_ACTIVITY_VIEW_TESTID).toBeVisible()` fails

**Errors**:
```
Error: locator.waitFor: Error: strict mode violation: locator('text=Security mode updated') resolved to 2 elements:
> 407 | await expect(modeSelect).toHaveValue('balanced');
    at neo-conversation.e2e.ts:406:52

Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed — element(s) not found
> 555 | await expect(page.getByTestId(NEO_ACTIVITY_VIEW_TESTID)).toBeVisible();
```

**Likely cause for (1)**: `changeSecurityMode` helper uses `page.locator('text=Security mode updated')` which matches multiple DOM elements (likely the toast text plus an ARIA live region mirror). Strict mode fires.

**Likely cause for (2)**: `NEO_ACTIVITY_VIEW_TESTID` does not exist in the current UI, or the activity view tab is not accessible without AI (the test may need to be guarded with `isNeoAvailable`).

**Fix needed**: (1) Change `page.locator('text=Security mode updated')` to `page.getByText('Security mode updated').first()` or `page.locator('[role="status"]:has-text("Security mode updated")')`. (2) Inspect the `NEO_ACTIVITY_VIEW_TESTID` constant and verify it matches the current DOM testid; add `isNeoAvailable` guard if the view requires an active AI session.

---

### Root Cause C — `features-space-creation`: Strict mode on `getByRole('button', { name: 'Active' })`

**Tests**: `creates space and shows tabbed dashboard layout` — line 150

**Error**:
```
Error: strict mode violation: getByRole('button', { name: 'Active' }) resolved to 2 elements:
> 150 | await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Active' })).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });
    at space-creation.e2e.ts:150:62
```

**Likely cause**: Two buttons with accessible name containing "Active" exist simultaneously — the space task tab bar button ("Active 0") and another UI element (e.g., SpaceDetailPanel sidebar, status badge, or a space-list item). PR #1356 now makes the SpaceDashboard visible, which surfaces the tab bar; but another "Active" button appears in the same viewport.

**Fix needed**: Scope the locator to the space overview container: `page.getByTestId('space-overview-view').getByRole('button', { name: 'Active' })`.

---

### Root Cause D — `features-space-happy-path-pipeline`: Invalid status transition `in_progress → completed`

**Tests**: `task completion is reflected in task pane` — line 198

**Error**:
```
Error: page.evaluate: Error: Invalid status transition from 'in_progress' to 'completed'.
Allowed: done, blocked, cancelled
    at space-happy-path-pipeline.e2e.ts:198:14
```

**Likely cause**: The test calls `hub.request('spaceTask.update', { ..., status: 'completed' })` at line 213, but the valid terminal status value is `'done'`, not `'completed'`. The status value name in the API changed (or was never `completed`).

**Fix needed**: Change `status: 'completed'` to `status: 'done'` at `space-happy-path-pipeline.e2e.ts:213`.

---

### Root Cause E — `features-reviewer-feedback-loop`: `animate-pulse` assertion timed out due to live query propagation latency

**Tests**: `coding node is pulsing after re-activation` — line 334

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(locator).toHaveClass(/animate-pulse/) failed
Expected pattern: /animate-pulse/
Timeout: 5000ms
> 334 | await expect(codingNodeEl).toHaveClass(/animate-pulse/, { timeout: 5000 });
    at reviewer-feedback-loop.e2e.ts:334:32
```

**Context**: `codingNodeEl = page.getByTestId('node-{id}')` which resolves to `<g data-testid="node-...">`. The `animate-pulse` class is applied to this element in `WorkflowCanvas.tsx:718` when `status === 'active'`, which is derived from `nodeTasks.some((t) => t.status === 'in_progress')` (line 813). The class location is correct and unchanged.

**Root cause**: The 5000ms timeout was insufficient for the live query propagation chain: `spaceTask.update` RPC → SQLite write → live query notification → frontend store update → canvas re-render with `animate-pulse`. Under CI load this chain regularly exceeds 5s.

**Fix applied**: Increased the timeout from 5000ms to 15000ms (`reviewer-feedback-loop.e2e.ts:334`).

---

### Root Cause F — `features-space-navigation`: `space-detail-dashboard` button not visible after clicking space

**Tests**: `Level 1→2: NavRail Spaces → SpaceContextPanel → click space → SpaceDetailPanel` — line 102

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed — element(s) not found
Timeout: 10000ms
> 102 | await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="space-detail-dashboard"]')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
    at space-navigation.e2e.ts:102:72
```

**Likely cause**: After clicking `page.getByText(spaceName, { exact: true })` in the SpaceContextPanel, the SpaceDetailPanel does not open (or opens but its "Overview" button is obscured). The testid `space-detail-dashboard` exists in `SpaceDetailPanel.tsx:168`, so the component exists. The issue may be that clicking the space name navigates to the space route (`/space/:id`) instead of opening the SpaceDetailPanel overlay, or the panel is mounted but `md:hidden` due to some layout condition.

**Fix needed**: Debug whether clicking the space name opens SpaceDetailPanel or navigates away; may need to use a different click target (e.g., click the space list item's explicit "Open panel" trigger rather than the text).

---

### Root Cause G — `features-space-approval-gate-rejection`: `view-artifacts-btn` not visible / gate click timeout

**Tests**: `rejecting via GateArtifactsView closes overlay and transitions run to needs_attention` — line 182/199

**Error**:
```
TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
- locator resolved to <g data-gate-id="plan-approval-gate" data-testid="gate-icon-waiting_human">…</g>
> 200 | await expect(page.getByTestId('view-artifacts-btn')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });
    at space-approval-gate-rejection.e2e.ts:199:21
```

**Likely cause**: `view-artifacts-btn` is not visible on the canvas within 5000ms after the run starts in `waiting_human` state. The test sequence: start run → wait for `gate-icon-waiting_human` → click it → expect `view-artifacts-btn`. If the gate popup that contains `view-artifacts-btn` does not appear after clicking the gate icon `<g>`, the 5s timeout fires. SVG `<g>` elements may have pointer-event issues — the click might not reach the element's event handler.

**Fix needed**: Investigate whether clicking `gate-icon-waiting_human` (an SVG `<g>`) reliably opens the gate popup; may need `page.getByTestId('gate-icon-waiting_human').click({ force: true })` or a different click target within the SVG.

---

### Root Cause H — `features-space-task-fullwidth`: Tab bar ('Overview') still visible in fullwidth mode

**Tests**: `opens task in fullwidth pane and hides tab bar` — line 90

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(locator).not.toBeVisible() failed — Expected: not visible
63 × locator resolved to <button data-active="false" data-testid="space-detail-dashboard" class="...">
> 90 | await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Overview', exact: true })).not.toBeVisible();
    at space-task-fullwidth.e2e.ts:90:81
```

**Likely cause**: In fullwidth task mode, the SpaceDetailPanel's "Overview" button (`data-testid="space-detail-dashboard"`) is expected to be hidden, but it remains visible. Either (a) the fullwidth layout no longer hides the SpaceDetailPanel sidebar, (b) the test is checking the wrong element (the Overview button in the task view vs. the sidebar), or (c) the fullwidth route has a different implementation that keeps the sidebar visible.

**Fix needed**: Verify what the expected fullwidth behavior is — should the SpaceDetailPanel sidebar be hidden when a task is open in fullwidth mode? If so, find and fix the CSS/layout logic that should hide it. If the expected behavior changed (sidebar stays visible), update the test.

---

### Root Cause I — `settings-tools-modal`: `openToolsModal` returns `undefined` (missing return statement)

**Tests**: All 7 tests in the suite fail with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`

**Error**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getByText')
> 67 | await expect(dialog.getByText('App MCP Servers', { exact: true })).toBeVisible();
    at tools-modal.e2e.ts:67:23
```

**Root cause**: `openToolsModal(page)` at `tools-modal.e2e.ts:36–55` has no `return` statement. Every test does `const dialog = await openToolsModal(page)` and gets `undefined`. All subsequent `dialog.getByText(...)` calls throw TypeError.

PR #1353 fixed `button[aria-label="Session options"]` → `getByTitle('Session options')` and added `waitForWebSocketConnected`, but did **not** add `return getModal(page)` at the end of the function.

**Fix**: Add `return getModal(page);` as the last line of `openToolsModal` in `packages/e2e/tests/settings/tools-modal.e2e.ts`.

---

### Root Cause J — `responsive-tablet` (LLM): `closePanelButton` not in viewport

**Tests**: `should display sidebar on tablet and use session` — line 45 (nested `closePanelButton`)

**Error**:
```
TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
2 × waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
112 × waiting for element to be visible, enabled and stable
> 45 | await expect(closePanelButton(page)).toBeInViewport({ timeout: 5000 });
    at tablet.e2e.ts:45
```

**Likely cause**: The tablet test tries to verify that at tablet viewport (768px), a close-panel or hamburger button is visible. The `closePanelButton` selector (`button[title="Close panel"]`) targets a button that only exists when the Neo panel is already open. If the Neo panel isn't opened first, no close button exists. This may be an ordering issue — `openMobilePanel` is called in a later test, not in this one.

**Fix needed**: Investigate whether `openMobilePanel` needs to be called before asserting `closePanelButton` visibility, or whether the test assertion should check a different element that's always visible at tablet width.

---

### Root Cause K — `features-reference-autocomplete` (LLM): Pre-existing no-git-repo issue

**Tests**: All tests — `Worktree creation failed — task requires isolation`

**Error**: Same pre-existing issue documented in all prior health check entries. E2E workspace path (`/tmp/tmp.*`) is not a git repository; `WorktreeManager.findGitRoot()` returns null.

**Status**: Unresolved — no fix PR open yet. Needs one of: (1) `git init` in E2E workspace setup, (2) backend fallback for non-git workspaces, or (3) test re-categorization.
