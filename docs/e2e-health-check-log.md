# E2E Test Health Check Log

This document tracks findings from recurring CI health check missions on the `dev` branch.

## 2026-03-22 — Check Run #23408422793 (and queued #23408701119)

### CI Run Overview
- **Run ID**: 23408422793
- **Branch**: dev
- **Status**: Completed (errors in e2e jobs)

### Build/Discover Jobs
All passed:
- `build` — Build web bundle: **PASSED**
- `discover` — Discover E2E tests: **PASSED**
- `All Tests Pass` — Status aggregator: **PASSED** (but downstream jobs had failures)

### E2E Test Failures

#### Root Cause 1: UI Terminology Mismatch
E2E tests (mission-terminology suite, 11 failing tests) were written expecting **"Missions"** labels in the UI, but the actual UI implementation used **"Goals"** terminology. This is inconsistent with the Mission System documentation in `CLAUDE.md` which specifies "Mission" as the canonical V2 term.

**Files changed**: `packages/web/src/islands/Room.tsx`, `packages/web/src/islands/RoomContextPanel.tsx`, `packages/web/src/components/room/GoalsEditor.tsx`

**Fix**: Renamed all UI labels from "Goals" to "Missions" to match test expectations and Mission System terminology.

#### Root Cause 2: LiveQuery Task Notification Gap
`TaskRepository` was missing `reactiveDb.notifyChange('tasks')` calls after all mutation methods:
- `createTask` — no notifyChange
- `updateTask` — no notifyChange
- `deleteTask` — no notifyChange
- `archiveTask` — no notifyChange
- `promoteDraftTasksByCreator` — no notifyChange

This meant LiveQuery subscriptions never fired when tasks were created/modified via RPC handlers, causing `roomStore.tasks.value` to remain empty in e2e tests.

**Files changed**:
- `packages/daemon/src/storage/repositories/task-repository.ts` — added `reactiveDb` param + notifyChange calls
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/task-manager.ts` — pass `this.reactiveDb`
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/room-manager.ts` — add `reactiveDb` param, pass to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/room/managers/goal-manager.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/task-handlers.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to TaskRepository
- `packages/daemon/src/lib/rpc-handlers/index.ts` — pass `reactiveDb` to RoomManager
- Unit/integration tests: all updated to pass `reactiveDb` / `noOpReactiveDb`

### PR
- **PR**: https://github.com/lsm/neokai/pull/717
